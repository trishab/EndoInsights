TI  - Expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 mRNA in human idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 5371-5
AB  - Macrophages are thought to play an important role in the pathologic changes 
      associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The mechanisms for increased 
      monocyte/macrophage recruitment in IPF are unknown. Monocyte chemoattractant 
      protein 1 (MCP-1) is the predominant monocyte chemoattractant secreted by a 
      variety of different cell types in culture. We examined the expression of MCP-1 
      mRNA and its protein product in vivo in IPF and non-IPF lung specimens by in situ 
      hybridization and immunocytochemistry. The cell types expressing MCP-1 in vivo 
      were identified by immunostaining with specific antibodies. We demonstrated the 
      expression of MCP-1 mRNA in pulmonary epithelial cells, in monocytes/macrophages, 
      and in vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Lung epithelial cells in 
      patients with IPF strongly expressed MCP-1 mRNA and its protein product. In 
      contrast, epithelial cells in non-IPF specimens did not express MCP-1 mRNA. 
      Macrophages and vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells were shown to 
      express MCP-1 in both IPF and non-IPF lung specimens. These findings provide a 
      basis for the understanding of the in vivo physiologic processes that mediate 
      monocyte/macrophage recruitment and infiltration in the lung interstitium and the 
      pathologic state contributing to an increased alveolar monocyte/macrophage 
      population and inflammation in IPF.

TI  - Increased expression of the interleukin-8 gene by alveolar macrophages in 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. A potential mechanism for the recruitment and 
      activation of neutrophils in lung fibrosis.
PG  - 1802-10
AB  - Neutrophil migration into the airspaces of the lung is thought to contribute to 
      the alveolar damage and subsequent fibrosis in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
      (IPF). Interleukin 8 (IL-8), a monocyte- and macrophage-derived cytokine, 
      displays potent chemotactic and activating properties towards neutrophils and 
      thus may contribute to the pathogenesis of IPF. The objective of this 
      investigation was to quantify the spontaneous expression of IL-8 transcripts by 
      alveolar macrophages from normal healthy volunteers and individuals with IPF. A 
      quantitative assay employing reverse transcription of mRNA and the polymerase 
      chain reaction was utilized. The level of IL-8 mRNA in alveolar macrophages was 
      found to be significantly elevated in individuals with lone IPF or with lung 
      fibrosis associated with connective tissue disorders compared to normal healthy 
      controls. Moreover, the level of IL-8 mRNA in the 23 individuals with IPF 
      correlated with the number of neutrophils per milliliter in their bronchoalveolar 
      lavage (BAL) and with the degree of disease severity. In addition, the level of 
      IL-8 protein in BAL was found to reflect the pattern of IL-8 mRNA expression by 
      alveolar macrophages. These data suggest that IL-8 derived from alveolar 
      macrophages may significantly contribute to neutrophil involvement in the 
      pathogenesis of IPF.

TI  - Early cellular events in pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 331-55
AB  - In this review we have surveyed recent investigations of early cellular events in 
      pulmonary fibrosis both in animal models and in human diseases. Analysis of the 
      interactions of the numerous cell types in the lung following injury is an almost 
      overwhelmingly complex enterprise. In the animal models experimental design has a 
      profound effect on results, making it difficult to compare studies when species, 
      fibrogenic agent, dose, route of exposure, schedule of administration, time 
      course, and analytical methods may not be equivalent. In human diseases we are 
      rarely able to obtain data at precisely the same time point in the course of the 
      disease even among patients in the same study, and possible confounding variables 
      present are legion. Transcending these difficulties for the moment, can we draw 
      any conclusions from our current knowledge of early cellular interactions in 
      pulmonary fibrosis? What is striking is not that there are so many agents that 
      can potentially induce pulmonary fibrosis, but that the lung has such 
      capabilities for recovery. Although the major effector cells may all initially 
      participate in damaging the lung and initiating fibrosis, there is evidence that 
      they may also have the capacity to participate in subsequent repair. Macrophages 
      may initially recruit fibroblasts and stimulate them to proliferate, only to 
      suppress them subsequently. Macrophage production of prostaglandins can lead to 
      suppression of macrophage, neutrophil and lymphocyte responses, thus attenuating 
      tissue injury and the development of fibrosis. Neutrophils may initially release 
      toxic metabolites and enzymes that damage parenchyma. However, there is evidence 
      that they may later play a role in attenuating fibrosis, perhaps through 
      collagenase secretion, or through as yet unknown mechanisms. Lymphocytes may 
      initially participate in a number of damaging ways by secreting chemoattractants 
      for other cells and participating in destructive autoimmune processes. However, 
      there is evidence that subpopulations of T cells may dramatically shift during 
      the course of fibrosis, leading to attenuation of the process. It may thus be 
      useful to consider irreversible pulmonary fibrosis as the end result of a process 
      in which the balance of normal injury/repair mechanisms is disrupted. There is 
      clearly no single "fibrogenic event." Rather, there seem to be a number of places 
      where disruption of balance/repair processes may begin. In diseases of unknown 
      etiology such as sarcoidosis or IPF, loss of control may occur at the genetic 
      level, leading to the destructive alveolitis that is the apparent precursor of 
      fibrosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

TI  - Maximum isokinetic ankle plantar and dorsal flexion torques in trained subjects.
PG  - 393-404
AB  - Isokinetic ankle plantar- and dorsal-flexion torques, IPF and IDF, respectively, 
      were measured in twenty-five physically healthy athletes, fifteen males and ten 
      females, with simultaneous recording of rectified, linearly enveloped surface 
      electromyograms, and peak electromyographic tensions (PEMG). Angular delays from 
      the start of motion to occurrence of peak torques were also registered. 
      Manoeuvres were performed in two knee positions. For comparison of strength 30 
      non-athletic (untrained) controls were included. IPF, but not IDF, was greater in 
      the trained than in the untrained subjects. Formulae for estimation of IPF at 30 
      degrees differ between trained and untrained subjects. Smaller gender differences 
      in maximum strength for trained than for untrained subjects suggest that habitual 
      rather than genetic dissimilarities cause sex differences in strength. Slope 
      differences in the negative exponential models which characterize IPF and IDF as 
      functions of increasing velocity of angular motion may be caused by different 
      structural properties of ankle flexors and extensors. A lower PEMG of the m. 
      gastrocnemius in the flexed than in the extended knee positions can explain the 
      lower IPFs, suggesting that mechanical rather than supraspinal factors cause 
      postural IPF differences. In contrast, greater IDF in the flexed than in the 
      extended knee positions may indicate that neurogenic mechanisms are involved.

TI  - Modulation of fibroblast activity in histiocytosis X by platelet-derived growth 
      factor.
PG  - 701-5
AB  - Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) was shown to modulate fibroblast activity 
      in interstitial lung diseases like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The role 
      of PDGF in fibrosing mechanisms in histiocytosis X is unclear. Eight patients 
      with histiocytosis X, five patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and 
      nine patients with no evidence of interstitial lung disease underwent 
      bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The c-sis gene (a proto-oncogen encoding for the 
      B-chain of PDGF) expression was measured by gene hybridization revealing an 
      upregulated c-sis transcript in the group of histiocytosis X and patients, 
      whereas no c-sis expression was detectable in the control group. The alveolar 
      macrophage supernatants from histiocytosis X patients and from the control group 
      were incubated with a human lung fibroblast cell line (WI-38). The mitosis rate 
      was measured by tritiated thymidine incorporation and collagen production was 
      estimated by determining the procollagen III peptide concentration in fibroblast 
      supernatants. Tritiated thymidine uptake was increased 1.6 times in histiocytosis 
      X compared with the control group (p < 0.01). Procollagen-III-peptide levels in 
      fibroblast supernatants after incubation with alveolar macrophage supernatants 
      from histiocytosis X were elevated 2.5 times compared with the control group (p < 
      0.01). Prior to incubation with the WI-38 cell line, the cell supernatant then 
      was preincubated with nonpreserved anti-human PDGF (AA- and BB-chain) resulting 
      in an 80% decrease of tritiated thymidine uptake and procollagen-III-peptide 
      production in the group of histiocytosis X patients compared with native 
      supernatants. No significant change in fibroblast activity was seen in the 
      control group. Preincubation with nonpreservated Ki-T2 antibodies as pan 
      T-lymphocyte marker did not show significant differences in both groups excluding 
      unspecific antibody inhibition. These findings suggest increased PDGF production 
      by alveolar macrophages in histiocytosis X patients. The PDGF is in part 
      responsible for increased fibroblast replication and collagen production.

AB  - To clarify the pathogenesis of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP), we 
      compared the data of interstitial pneumonia (IP) associated with collagen 
      vascular disease (CVD) with those of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). These 
      disorders are found to have similar clinical, radiographic, and morphological 
      findings, and lung function. However, the in vitro behavior of fibroblasts from 
      CVD-IP and IPF, and the detection of soluble ICAM-1 were different. Further, in 
      the T cell receptor repertoire, the predominance of different genes was found in 
      bronchoalveolar lavage cells from CVD and IPF. These differences could partly 
      explain the variability of IP pattern seen in CVD. In summary, our results 
      indicate the possibility that CVD-IF and IPF result from different mechanisms 
      although they share the same spectrum of pulmonary changes.

AB  - To better understand the mechanisms responsible for the increase in numbers of 
      fibroblasts and increased collagen synthesis in fibrotic intestitial lung 
      diseases, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-A and PDGF-B, PDGF receptor-alpha 
      and -beta, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), and IGF-I receptor were 
      evaluated immunohistochemically. Additionally, the messenger ribonucleic acids 
      (mRNAs) for PDGF-A and PDGF-B, PDGF receptor-alpha and -beta, and IGF-I were 
      investigated by in situ hybridization in alveolar macrophages and lung tissues 
      from patients with interstitial lung disease. In specimens of bronchoalveolar 
      lavage fluid (BALF), PDGF-A, PDGF-B, and IGF-I were local in alveolar macrophages 
      in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), patients with sarcoidosis 
      (Sar), and normal individuals. Although there were no differences between IPF and 
      Sar in terms of the staining intensity or number of positive cells, the number of 
      such cells was smaller in the normal controls. In lung tissues with early-stage 
      IPF, PDGF and IGF-I proteins were localized exclusively in alveolar macrophages, 
      mononuclear phagocytes, fibroblasts, alveolar Type II cells, vascular endothelial 
      cells, and vascular smooth-muscle cells. In lung tissues with late-stage IPF and 
      those from normal controls, only alveolar macrophages contained PDGF and IGF-I 
      proteins. Interestingly, the cellular localizations of PDGF receptor-alpha and 
      -beta, and of IGF-I receptor were the same as those of the PDGF and IGF-I 
      proteins in early-stage IPF, whereas these cells were not positive for any of 
      these substances in late-stage IPF or normal controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

TI  - Insulin gene: organisation, expression and regulation.
PG  - 164-73
AB  - Insulin, a major hormone of the endocrine pancreas, plays a key role in the 
      control of glucose homeostasis. This review discusses the mechanisms of 
      cell-specific expression and regulation of the insulin gene. Whereas expression 
      is restricted to islet beta-cells in adults, the insulin gene is more widely 
      expressed at several embryonic stages, although the role of extrapancreatic 
      expression is still unclear. beta-cell-specific expression relies on the 
      interactions of 5'-flanking sequence motifs of the promoter with a number of 
      ubiquitous and islet-specific transcription factors. IEF1 and IPF-1, by their 
      binding to the E and A boxes, respectively, of the insulin gene promoter, appear 
      to be the major determinants of beta-cell-specific expression. IEF1 is a 
      heterodimer of the basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors, 
      whereas IPF-1 belongs to the homeodomain-containing family. beta-cell specific 
      determinants are conserved throughout evolution, although the human insulin gene 
      5'-flanking sequence also contains a polymorphic minisatellite which is unique to 
      primates and may play a role in insulin gene regulation. Glucose modulates 
      insulin gene transcription, with multiple elements of the promoter involved in 
      glucose responsiveness. Remarkably, IPF-1 and IEF1 are involved in both 
      beta-cell-specific expression and glucose regulation of the insulin gene. cAMP 
      also regulates insulin gene transcription through a CRE, in response to various 
      hormonal stimuli. On the whole, recent studies have provided a better 
      understanding of beta-cell differentiation and function.

TI  - Purification of the beta-cell glucose-sensitive factor that transactivates the 
      insulin gene differentially in normal and transformed islet cells.
PG  - 15057-62
AB  - The beta cell-specific glucose-sensitive factor (GSF), which binds the A3 motif 
      of the rat I and human insulin promoters, is modulated by extracellular glucose. 
      A single mutation in the GSF binding site of the human insulin promoter abolishes 
      the stimulation by high glucose only in normal islets, supporting the suggested 
      physiological role of GSF in the glucose-regulated expression of the insulin 
      gene. GSF binding activity was observed in all insulin-producing cells. We have 
      therefore purified this activity from the rat insulinoma RIN and found that a 
      single polypeptide of 45 kDa was responsible for DNA binding. Its amino acid 
      sequence, determined by microsequencing, provided direct evidence that GSF 
      corresponds to insulin promoter factor 1 (IPF-1; also known as PDX-1) and that, 
      in addition to its essential roles in development and differentiation of 
      pancreatic islets and in beta cell-specific gene expression, it functions as 
      mediator of the glucose effect on insulin gene transcription in differentiated 
      beta cells. The human cDNA coding for GSF/IPF-1 has been cloned, its cell and 
      tissue distribution is described. Its expression in the glucagon-producing cell 
      line alpha TC1 transactivates the wild-type human insulin promoter more 
      efficiently than the mutated construct. It is demonstrated that high levels of 
      ectopic GSF/IPF-1 inhibit the expression of the human insulin gene in normal 
      islets, but not in transformed beta TC1 cells. These results suggest the 
      existence of a control mechanism, such as requirement for a coactivator of 
      GSF/IPF-1, which may be present in limiting amounts in normal as opposed to 
      transformed beta cells.

TI  - Reduced insulin, GLUT2, and IDX-1 in beta-cells after partial pancreatectomy.
PG  - 258-64
AB  - Reduction of GLUT2 is associated with loss of glucose-induced insulin secretion 
      in genetic and chemical diabetes and in transplanted islets exposed to chronic 
      hyperglycemia. To examine the mechanisms for this loss of GLUT2 in normal islets 
      exposed to hyperglycemia, we performed studies on Sprague Dawley rats 4 weeks 
      after a 90% partial pancreatectomy (Px), a well-characterized model of 
      hyperglycemia. GLUT2 immunofluorescence in the beta-cell of Px rats was greatly 
      reduced. Western blot analysis of homogenates of isolated Px islets also showed a 
      reduction in GLUT2 protein; densitometry measurements were 36 +/- 3% of values 
      from islets of sham-operated controls. Insulin protein levels were decreased to a 
      similar extent. Islet GLUT2 and insulin mRNA were measured with quantitative 
      reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The level of GLUT2 mRNA from Px 
      islets was 24 +/- 4% of that of islets from sham-operated controls; similar 
      results were obtained for insulin. Because both these beta-cell-specific messages 
      were reduced, we analyzed the Px islets for the pancreas-duodenum-specific 
      transcription factor IDX-1(IPF-1, STF-1, PDX-1) protein. It was markedly reduced 
      (approximately 80%) in islets from the Px rats. These data suggest that 1) the 
      loss of GLUT2 protein associated with hyperglycemia is at least partially 
      explained by reduced levels of the GLUT2 gene transcripts; 2) the reduction of 
      beta-cell insulin content during chronic hyperglycemia may not be completely due 
      to degranulation (reduced levels of gene transcripts may play a role); and 3) the 
      reduction in the transcription factor IDX-1 raises the possibility that 
      dysregulation of transcription factors may contribute to the abnormal beta-cell 
      function found in states of chronic hyperglycemia.

TI  - Elevated expression of endothelin-1 and endothelin-converting enzyme-1 in 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: possible involvement of proinflammatory cytokines.
PG  - 187-93
AB  - Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a vasoconstrictor, bronchoconstrictor, and mitogenic 
      peptide which is enzymatically converted from a biologically inactive big ET to 
      mature ET (21 amino acid) by the ET-converting enzyme (ECE). Here, we investigate 
      the expression of ECE-1, big ET-1, and ET-1 in the lungs of patients with 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and compare it to those of normal subjects 
      using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. In normal lungs, focal 
      moderate expression of all three molecules is localized to airway epithelium, 
      pulmonary endothelium, and airway and vascular smooth muscle cells. Serous 
      bronchial glands also expressed ET-1 and ECE-1. In IPF, strong diffuse expression 
      of ECE-1 was seen in airway epithelium, proliferating type II pneumocytes, and in 
      endothelial and inflammatory cells. ECE-1 immunostaining was colocalized to big 
      ET-1 and ET-1 immunostaining, and correlated with disease activity (P < 0.05). To 
      study regulatory mechanisms of ET-1 and ECE-1 expression, human normal bronchial 
      epithelial (NBE) cells were treated with cytokines and analyzed by 
      radioimmunoassay and Northern blot. Incubation of human NBE cells with IL-1alpha 
      and -beta or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) resulted in a significant 
      increase in ET-1 release and mRNA expression. TNFalpha resulted in a significant 
      increase in ECE-1 mRNA expression. These findings demonstrated the colocalization 
      of the precursor and active ET-1, and ECE-1 in the same cell, and that ECE-1 
      expression is elevated in IPF. In addition, increased expression of ET-1 and 
      ECE-1 in IPF may be mediated by proinflammatory cytokines.

      and in situ hybridization.
PG  - 388-97
AB  - Pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by diffuse 
      fibrous remodeling of alveolar spaces. Although much interest is focused on 
      mechanisms of the inflammatory process in pulmonary fibrosis, little is known 
      about the repair and regenerative process. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), 
      originally discovered as a mitogen for hepatocyte regeneration, is now recognized 
      as a multifunctional mesenchymal factor for epithelial regeneration, including 
      the regeneration of alveolar type II epithelial cells. Involvement of HGF and its 
      receptor (c-met) is evident in animal models of acute lung injury produced by 
      hydrochloride inhalation. We studied the role of HGF in patients with idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) (25 cases), lung fibrosis associated with rheumatoid 
      arthritis (22 cases), and sarcoidosis (39 cases). Immunohistochemical evaluation 
      demonstrated that hyperplastic alveolar type II epithelial cells, as well as 
      alveolar macrophages, were strongly stained with anti-HGF antibody in tissues of 
      patients with IPF. The concentration of HGF in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 
      (BALF) was significantly higher than in normal controls (0.23 +/- 0.09 pg/microg) 
      in patients with IPF (0.77 +/- 0.88 pg of HGF/microg of albumin, P < 0.001), lung 
      fibrosis associated with rheumatoid arthritis (0.50 +/- 0.64 pg/microg, P < 
      0.01), and sarcoidosis (0.41 +/- 0.61 pg/microg, P < 0.05). In situ hybridization 
      revealed mRNA for HGF in alveolar macrophages (especially small monocytelike 
      macrophages). These results indicate that the increase in HGF concentration in 
      patients' peripheral air spaces is due to augmented HGF production by alveolar 
      epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages. HGF, through a paracrine mechanism, 
      may play an important role in the repair and healing of the inflammatory lung 
      damage in pulmonary fibrosis.

TI  - Expression of RANTES by bronchoalveolar lavage cells in nonsmoking patients with 
      interstitial lung diseases.
PG  - 526-31
AB  - Emphasis has recently been placed on the roles of chemotactic cytokines called 
      chemokines to explain the accumulation of inflammatory cells in the lung that may 
      precede or accompany pulmonary fibrosis in interstitial lung diseases. We 
      hypothesized that RANTES, a member of the C-C chemokines, is one such chemokine. 
      Bronchoalveolar lavage was done in 20 patients with sarcoidosis, 10 patients with 
      interstitial pneumonia associated with collagen vascular disease (CVD-IP), 10 
      patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and eight healthy volunteers 
      (HV), all of whom were never-smokers. We semiquantitated the spontaneous RANTES 
      mRNA expression by a competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction 
      (RT-PCR) technique, and measured the levels of RANTES protein by enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay. In all disease groups the expression of RANTES mRNA by 
      bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells and the levels of RANTES protein in 
      BALF were significantly increased compared with those in HV. Patients with 
      sarcoidosis and CVD-IP had a significant positive correlation between the 
      expression of RANTES mRNA by BALF cells and BALF lymphocytosis. The amounts of 
      RANTES mRNA expressed by peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the levels of 
      RANTES protein in serum did not differ among all study groups. Our study 
      demonstrates the adaptability of a semiquantitative RT-PCR method for determining 
      cytokine mRNA expression in vivo. Our results suggest that RANTES may be one of 
      the chemokines that are involved in the mechanism for the accumulation of 
      inflammatory cells in the lung of some distinct interstitial lung diseases.

TI  - Insulin promoter factor-1 gene mutation linked to early-onset type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus directs expression of a dominant negative isoprotein.
PG  - 232-41
AB  - The homeodomain transcription factor insulin promoter factor-1 (IPF-1) is 
      required for development of the pancreas and also mediates glucose-responsive 
      stimulation of insulin gene transcription. Earlier we described a human subject 
      with pancreatic agenesis attributable to homozygosity for a cytosine deletion in 
      codon 63 of the IPF-1 gene (Pro63fsdelC). Pro63fsdelC resulted in the premature 
      truncation of an IPF-1 protein which lacked the homeodomain required for DNA 
      binding and nuclear localization. Subsequently, we linked the heterozygous state 
      of this mutation with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the extended family of the 
      pancreatic agenesis proband. In the course of expressing the mutant IPF-1 protein 
      in eukaryotic cells, we detected a second IPF-1 isoform, recognized by COOH- but 
      not NH2-terminal-specific antisera. This isoform localizes to the nucleus and 
      retains DNA-binding functions. We provide evidence that internal translation 
      initiating at an out-of-frame AUG accounts for the appearance of this protein. 
      The reading frame crosses over to the wild-type IPF-1 reading frame at the site 
      of the point deletion just carboxy proximal to the transactivation domain. Thus, 
      the single mutated allele results in the translation of two IPF-1 isoproteins, 
      one of which consists of the NH2-terminal transactivation domain and is 
      sequestered in the cytoplasm and the second of which contains the COOH-terminal 
      DNA-binding domain, but lacks the transactivation domain. Further, the 
      COOH-terminal mutant IPF-1 isoform does not activate transcription and inhibits 
      the transactivation functions of wild-type IPF-1. This circumstance suggests that 
      the mechanism of diabetes in these individuals may be due not only to reduced 
      gene dosage, but also to a dominant negative inhibition of transcription of the 
      insulin gene and other beta cell-specific genes regulated by the mutant IPF-1.

TI  - Expression and transcriptional control of the Salmonella typhimurium Ipf fimbrial 
      operon by phase variation.
PG  - 311-20
AB  - The lpf operon mediates adhesion of Salmonella typhimurium to murine Peyer's 
      patches. To investigate expression of this virulence factor, a transcriptional 
      fusion between the lpf operon and the genes lacZYA of Escherichia coli was 
      constructed and introduced into the S. typhimurium chromosome. The resulting 
      strain yielded both Lac+ and Lac- colony phenotypes. Alternation between Lac+ 
      (phase ON) and Lac- (phase OFF) phenotypes occurred by a heritable phase 
      variation mechanism, as inoculation of broth cultures with bacteria picked from a 
      Lac+ colony gave rise to a considerably higher proportion of Lac+ colonies than 
      inoculation with bacteria picked from a Lac- colony. During growth in vitro, 
      phase transition from ON to OFF and from OFF to ON occurred at rates 6.8 x 10(-3) 
      and 2.4 x 10(-4) events per cell per generation respectively. In a murine 
      intestinal organ culture model, selection for the ON expression state occurred 
      when attached bacteria were recovered from Peyer's patches, suggesting that Lac 
      phase variation correlated with expression of lpf mediated adherence. Selection 
      for either the ON or the OFF expression state of the Ipf operon in vivo was 
      studied in mice immunized with either GST or GST-LpfA fusion protein. A strong 
      selection against phase ON cells occurred only in animals immunized with 
      GST-LpfA. The ability of animals immunized with GST-LpfA to distinguish between 
      phase ON and phase OFF bacteria provided evidence for the presence of LpfA 
      fimbrial protein in phase ON cells and for its exposure to the immune system.

TI  - Microsatellite instability in transforming growth factor-beta 1 type II receptor 
      gene in alveolar lining epithelial cells of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 398-404
AB  - It has been reported that transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, which plays an 
      integral role in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), 
      suppresses proliferation of alveolar epithelial cells in vitro. Although 
      hyperplastic lesions of alveolar lining epithelial cells (ALECs) are 
      characteristic pathologic features of IPF, the mechanism of their involvement in 
      the pathogenesis has not yet been extensively studied. On the assumption that the 
      hyperplastic ALECs have escaped from the growth-inhibitory effects of TGF-beta, 
      we searched for mutations in the microsatellite of the TGF-beta receptor type II 
      (T beta RII) gene. To detect a deletion in the polyadenine tract in exon 3 of the 
      T beta RII gene, cells were isolated by microdissection from lung sections of IPF 
      patients, and DNA was extracted from these cells and amplified by high-fidelity 
      polymerase chain reaction. A total of 121 sites of hyperplastic ALECs from 11 IPF 
      patients were analyzed, and a one-base-pair deletion was detected in nine sites 
      from five patients. The mutation was also detected in smooth muscle-like cells of 
      the thickened pulmonary artery. In some tissue areas where the deletion was 
      detected, low T beta RII expression was confirmed by immunohistochemical 
      staining. These data suggest that microsatellite instability in the T beta RII 
      gene occurred in some lesions of hyperplastic ALECs in IPF, although at a low 
      incidence, and that this genetic disorder might play a partial role in the 
      pathologic changes of IPF.

TI  - Hemofiltrate CC chemokines with unique biochemical properties: HCC-1/CCL14a and 
      HCC-2/CCL15.
PG  - 357-66
AB  - The hemofiltrate CC chemokines CCL14a (formerly HCC-1), CCL14b (formerly HCC-3), 
      and CCL15 (formerly HCC-2) are encoded by mono- as well as bicistronic 
      transcripts from a tandem gene arrangement on human chromosome 17q11.2. The 
      transcription and splicing into several mono- and bicistronic transcripts of this 
      gene complex are unique for human genes. No corresponding mechanism is known in 
      nonprimate mammalian species such as mice and rats. The extremely high 
      concentration of CCL14a in human plasma is exceptional for chemokines and led to 
      the identification of this chemokine. Several molecular forms of CCL14a have been 
      isolated and investigated. The mature propeptide CCL14a(1-74) is a low-affinity 
      agonist of CCR1 which is converted to a high-affinity agonist of CCR1 and CCR5 on 
      proteolytic processing by serine proteases. In contrast, CCL15 is characterized 
      using molecular forms deduced from the mRNA/cDNA and shown to activate cells via 
      CCR1 and CCR3, also dependent on the amino-terminal length. Hemofiltrate CC 
      chemokines are chemoattractants for different types of leukocytes including 
      monocytes, eosinophils, T cells, dendritic cells, and neutrophils. In this 
      review, we emphasize the genomic organization, expression patterns, and 
      biochemical properties of CCL14a, CCL14b, and CCL15. We report results of 
      significance for the development of therapeutic strategies, especially concerning 
      HIV infection and inflammatory diseases.

TI  - CCL18/DC-CK-1/PARC up-regulation in hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
PG  - 610-6
AB  - Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is a lung inflammatory disorder characterized 
      by accumulation of T lymphocytes. However, the mechanisms implicated in this 
      process remain undefined. We examined the expression of dendritic cell 
      (DC)-derived CC chemokine 1 (CK1)/CCL18, a chemokine putatively involved in naive 
      T cell recruitment, in lungs from 10 patients with HP, 9 patients with idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and 20 healthy lungs. CCL18 was measured by real-time 
      quantitative PCR and localized in lungs by in situ hybridization and 
      immunohistochemistry. CCL18 expression was significantly increased in lungs 
      affected by HP in comparison with lungs affected by IPF (2,085+/-393 vs. 
      1,023+/-110; P<0.05) and controls (2,085+/-393 vs. 467+/-94; P<0.01). 
      Macrophages, DCs, and alveolar epithelial cells were the main sources of CCL18. 
      There was a direct correlation between the levels of tissue CCL18 and the number 
      of lymphocytes in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids. High levels of CCL18 were 
      detected in the subacute rather than the chronic phase of HP. These findings 
      suggest a role for CCL18 in the pathogenesis of HP.

TI  - Epstein-Barr virus and wild p53 in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 787-91
AB  - Both Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and p53 have independently been associated with 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). This study explores further whether a 
      relationship potentially exists between EBV and p53 in IPF, thereby providing a 
      possible mechanism for the role of EBV in the disease progression of IPF. Lung 
      tissue from open lung biopsies of 14 IPF patients was compared with a control 
      group of 19 patients. EBV status was determined using both immunohistochemistry 
      and PCR, while p53 expression was assessed with immunohistochemistry Seven of 14 
      IPF patients expressed p53 compared to one of 19 control subjects (P = 0.011). 
      Eight IPF patients and no controls were positive for EBV (P < 0.01). Four IPF 
      patients demonstrated both EBVand p53 expression compared with no controls, (P = 
      0.05). This study suggests that a relationship between EBV and p53 may exist in 
      patients with IPF.

TI  - p53 gene alteration in atypical epithelial lesions and carcinoma in patients with 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 1043-9
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is well known to be associated with lung 
      cancer. Several atypical epithelial lesions are frequently observed in the 
      fibrotic area in IPF patients, and they have been suspected to be related to lung 
      carcinogenesis. Several studies have suggested that p53 protein accumulation and 
      mutation occur in the early pathogenesis of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, 
      suggesting some abnormality of the p53 tumor-suppressor gene in interstitial lung 
      diseases. To examine the cause of the high frequency of lung cancer in IPF, we 
      examined the p53 changes in atypical epithelial lesions and carcinoma in patients 
      with IPF by immunohistochemistry and mutational analysis. We examined 19 lung 
      cancer patients with IPF who underwent surgical resection for lung cancer in our 
      institute. Paraffin-embedded tissues were treated by microwave and stained with 
      an anti-p53 antibody (RSP53) by the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method. 
      Mutations in exons 5 through 8 of the p53 gene were also examined by polymerase 
      chain reaction mediated single-strand conformation polymorphism (polymerase chain 
      reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism) analysis and DNA sequencing. 
      p53 protein was immunohistochemically detected in 13 (62%) of 21 squamous cell 
      carcinomas, 3 (60%) of 5 squamous metaplasia with atypia, 16 (54%) of 30 squamous 
      metaplasia, and 1 (4%) of 26 other hyperplastic lesions. p53 mutation was 
      detected in 12 (57%) of 21 squamous cell carcinomas, 2 (40%) of 5 squamous 
      metaplasia with atypia, 7 (23%) of 30 squamous metaplasia, and 0 (0%) of 26 other 
      hyperplastic lesions. In conclusion, there are frequent p53 gene alterations in 
      squamous metaplasia, which is distributed in the peripheral zone of the fibrotic 
      area in patients with IPF. The present findings might provide a clue to the 
      molecular mechanisms underlying the high incidence of lung cancer, especially 
      peripheral-type squamous cell carcinoma in IPF patients, and suggest that p53 
      gene alterations play an important role in the early stages of lung 
      carcinogenesis in patients with IPF.

TI  - Identification of a novel, multifunctional beta-defensin (human beta-defensin 3) 
      with specific antimicrobial activity. Its interaction with plasma membranes of 
      Xenopus oocytes and the induction of macrophage chemoattraction.
PG  - 257-64
AB  - Previous studies have shown the implication of beta-defensins in host defense of 
      the human body. The human beta-defensins 1 and 2 (hBD-1, hBD-2) have been 
      isolated by biochemical methods. Here we report the identification of a third 
      human beta-defensin, called human beta-defensin 3 (hBD-3; cDNA sequence, Genbank 
      accession no. AF295370), based on bioinformatics and functional genomic analysis. 
      Expression of hBD-3 is detected throughout epithelia of many organs and in 
      non-epithelial tissues. In contrast to hBD-2, which is upregulated by 
      microorganisms or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), hBD-3 expression is 
      increased particularly after stimulation by interferon-gamma. Synthetic hBD-3 
      exhibits a strong antimicrobial activity against gram-negative and gram-positive 
      bacteria and fungi, including Burkholderia cepacia. In addition, hBD-3 activates 
      monocytes and elicits ion channel activity in biomembranes, specifically in 
      oocytes of Xenopus laevis. This paper also shows that screening of genomic 
      sequences is a valuable tool with which to identify novel regulatory peptides. 
      Human beta-defensins represent a family of antimicrobial peptides differentially 
      expressed in most tissues, regulated by specific mechanisms, and exerting 
      physiological functions not only related to direct host defense.

TI  - Interleukin-1 gene cluster polymorphisms in sarcoidosis and idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis.
PG  - 148-51
AB  - Members of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) family are implicated in the pathogenesis of 
      sarcoidosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We have, therefore, 
      performed a case-control study to investigate a plausible association between 
      sarcoidosis and the polymorphisms in the IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-1 receptor 
      antagonist (IL-1Ra) genes. Further, as a separate question, we explored whether 
      the aforementioned genes of the IL-1 cluster are associated with IPF. Using PCR 
      with sequence-specific primers, IL-1alpha -889, IL-1beta -511, IL-1beta +3953, 
      and IL-1Ra intron 2 VNTR polymorphisms were determined in 348 white subjects of 
      West Slavonic ancestry (95 patients with sarcoidosis, 54 patients with IPF, and 
      199 healthy control subjects). The IL-1alpha -889 1.1 genotype was significantly 
      overrepresented in patients with sarcoidosis in comparison with control subjects 
      (60.0 versus 44.2%, p = 0.012, p(corr) = 0.047). The distribution of IL-1beta 
      -511, IL-1beta +3953, and IL-1Ra VNTR genotypes and alleles did not significantly 
      differ between the cases and controls. No association between IPF and the 
      investigated polymorphisms was found. Strong linkage disequilibrium between pairs 
      of polymorphic loci was observed. Further population studies are warranted to 
      confirm the observed association between sarcoidosis and the IL-1alpha 
      polymorphism and also to explore mechanisms of IL-1alpha -889 participation in 
      aberrant immune response in sarcoidosis.

TI  - Genetic predisposition and pathogenetic mechanisms of interstitial lung diseases 
      of unknown origin.
PG  - 17s-29s
AB  - Understanding of the cellular and cytokine interactions associated with 
      inflammation and fibrosis in interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) has increased 
      substantially during the past few years. Presently, many agents are known to have 
      the ability to induce ILDs, although only a small percentage of exposed 
      individuals will develop the disease. In addition, the majority of ILDs are of 
      unknown origin and many are labelled "idiopathic". Therefore, host 
      susceptibility, genetic factors and, possibly, environmental cofactors may be 
      important for the clinical expression of ILDs. The present review reports 
      evidence of the genetic predisposition to develop ILDs of unknown origin, more 
      specifically sarcoidosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), 
      lymphangioleio-myomatosis and ILDs, in systemic sclerosis. For instance, for 
      sarcoidosis and IPF several histocompatibility antigens have been associated with 
      the development and/or the clinical presentation of the disease. Furthermore, 
      there are also several types of ILD that are associated with inherited disorders, 
      of which the tuberous sclerosis complex is only one example. This clearly 
      indicates that pulmonary fibrosis can be influenced by genetic factors. Familial 
      occurrence of sarcoidosis and IPF is also well known, although the exact modes of 
      inheritance are debatable. Several studies have shown that extrinsic factors, 
      such as single or multiple fibrosing agents, probably contribute to the 
      development of clinical ILDs of unknown origin. It is probable that some of these 
      studies deal with patients who do not have classical IPF, as recently defined by 
      the American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) consensus. 
      Therefore, the true role of these extrinsic factors in the development of IPF, or 
      even sarcoidosis, remains speculative. With the help of animal studies and, more 
      specifically, by using knock-out mice, it may be possible in the near future to 
      unravel at least some of the genes that are responsible for the increased 
      susceptibility of the development of interstitial lung diseases.

TI  - Monogenic forms of obesity and diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 241-53
AB  - Great progress has been made in identifying several genes and in understanding 
      the molecular pathogenesis of inherited syndromes of obesity and diabetes 
      mellitus (DM). In humans, mutations in leptin, leptin receptor, 
      proopiomelanocortin (POMC), melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) and prohormone 
      convertase 1 (PC1) have been described in patients with severe obesity. Most of 
      these obesity disorders, with the exception of the MC4R mutations, exhibit 
      recessive inheritance and a distinct phenotype with varying degrees of 
      hypothalamic dysfunction, and they unravel the critical role of the central 
      leptin and melanocortin pathways in human appetite control and energy 
      homeostasis. Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a genetically and 
      clinically heterogeneous subtype of type 2 DM with early onset autosomal dominant 
      inheritance and a primary defect in insulin secretion. To date, six MODY genes 
      have been identified, the glucokinase gene and five beta cell-specific 
      transcription factor genes, hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha), 
      HNF-1beta, HNF-4alpha, insulin promoter factor-1 (IPF-1) and NeuroD1/BETA2. 
      Mitochondrial DNA mutations cause another form of DM with an insulin secretory 
      defect that is commonly associated with neurosensory hearing impairment, and has 
      strict maternal inheritance. At the other end of the spectrum are the inherited 
      syndromes of insulin resistance that are caused by mutations in the insulin 
      receptor gene and in the adipocyte-specific transcription factor PPARgamma. The 
      advances in our knowledge of the phenotypic manifestations and underlying 
      molecular mechanisms of genetic syndromes of obesity and DM raise expectations 
      for molecular diagnosis, as well as for more etiological therapies and better 
      prevention of the continuously increasing prevalence of obesity and DM in our 
      modern societies.

TI  - A pivotal role of cytosolic phospholipase A(2) in bleomycin-induced pulmonary 
      fibrosis.
PG  - 480-4
AB  - Pulmonary fibrosis is an interstitial disorder of the lung parenchyma whose 
      mechanism is poorly understood. Potential mechanisms include the infiltration of 
      inflammatory cells to the lungs and the generation of pro-inflammatory mediators. 
      In particular, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive and fatal form of 
      the disorder characterized by alveolar inflammation, fibroblast proliferation and 
      collagen deposition. Here, we investigated the role of cytosolic phospholipase 
      A(2) (cPLA(2)) in pulmonary fibrosis using cPLA(2)-null mutant mice, as cPLA(2) 
      is a key enzyme in the generation of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. Disruption of 
      the gene encoding cPLA(2) (Pla2g4a) attenuated IPF and inflammation induced by 
      bleomycin administration. Bleomycin-induced overproduction of thromboxanes and 
      leukotrienes in lung was significantly reduced in cPLA(2)-null mice. Our data 
      suggest that cPLA(2) has an important role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary 
      fibrosis. The inhibition of cPLA(2)-initiated pathways might provide a novel 
      therapeutic approach to pulmonary fibrosis, for which no pharmaceutical agents 
      are currently available.

TI  - Conserved CDR 3 region of T cell receptor BV gene in lymphocytes from 
      bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 140-9
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an inflammatory lung disease characterized 
      by the accumulation of inflammatory cells and deposition of collagen, resulting 
      in lung remodelling. High numbers of T cells are present in bronchoalveolar 
      lavage fluid (BALF) of IPF patients, although the characteristics of these cells 
      are yet to be determined. To elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms of IPF, we 
      analysed the T cell receptor (TCR) of BALF lymphocytes in three patients with IPF 
      and three healthy subjects as control. TCR repertoire of BALF lymphocytes and T 
      cell clonality were examined by family PCR and Southern blot analysis, and 
      single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), respectively. We observed that 
      the TCR repertoire in the lung was heterogeneous, both in the control subjects 
      and three patients with IPF. SSCP analysis demonstrated an increase in the number 
      of accumulated T cell clones in BALF of two of the three patients, but not in the 
      healthy subject. Furthermore, junctional sequence analysis showed the presence of 
      conserved amino acid motifs (ETGRSG, LAxG, QGQ, GxQP, GRxG, VAR, PGT, GTI, GGT, 
      TGR, LxLxQ, SGQ) in the TCR-CDR 3 region of BAL lymphocytes in patients with IPF, 
      whereas only two amino acid motifs (VTTG, GGE) were found in the control. Our 
      findings suggest that T cells in BALF of patients with IPF expand oligoclonally 
      in the lung, suggesting antigen stimulation of these cells.

TI  - The role of transcription factors in maturity-onset diabetes of the young.
PG  - 35-43
AB  - The study of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), an autosomal dominant 
      form of early-onset diabetes mellitus characterised by defective insulin 
      secretion has been extremely successful in two ways. Firstly it has enabled 
      definitive diagnosis for patients. This allows more accurate prediction of 
      disease and treatment requirements. Secondly it has facilitated an increased 
      understanding of the genes and pathways that are crucial for normal beta-cell 
      function. Five of the six MODY genes, TCF1 (encoding HNF-1alpha), TCF2 (encoding 
      HNF-1beta) HNF4A, insulin promoter factor (IPF)1, and NEUROD1, are transcription 
      factors that operate in a complex network of gene regulation. Several genes have 
      been shown to be regulated by the MODY transcription factors in a beta-cell 
      specific manner. This includes the co-regulation of HNF-1alpha and HNF-4alpha by 
      each other. The exact mechanism of how mutations in these transcription factors 
      result in diabetes in humans remains unknown. However, current opinion favours 
      pleiotropic adverse effects on many genes; extensive in vitro and in vivo studies 
      of these genes has highlighted their importance in both glucose sensing-insulin 
      secretion coupling and maintaining the fully differentiated beta-cell phenotype.

TI  - Titration of non-replicating adenovirus as a vector for transducing active 
      TGF-beta1 gene expression causing inflammation and fibrogenesis in the lungs of 
      C57BL/6 mice.
PG  - 183-201
AB  - Investigators have shown that interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) can be 
      induced in rats by overexpressing transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) 
      through a replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus vector instilled into the 
      lungs (Sime et al. 1997). We have shown that this vector induces IPF in 
      fibrogenic-resistant tumour necrosis factor alpha-receptor knockout 
      (TNF-alphaRKO) mice (Liu et al. 2001). The object of our studies is to understand 
      how peptide growth factors, such as TGF-beta1, mediate interstitial lung disease 
      (ILD). To do so, we must be able to manipulate the dose of the factor and sort 
      out its effects on multiple other mediators in the lung parenchyma. As a step in 
      this complex process, in the studies reported here, we have determined the 
      concentrations of the recombinant adenovirus vector carrying the gene for porcine 
      active TGF-beta1 (AVTGFbeta1) that have little apparent effect, cause clear 
      induction of disease, or severe disease. The disease largely resolves by 28 days 
      in all cases, thus providing a valuable model to understand the mechanisms of the 
      IPF that is mediated, at least in part, by TGF-beta1. The findings here show that 
      10(6) plaque-forming units (pfu) of AVTGFbeta1, provide essentially a 'no-effect' 
      dose, but even this amount of TGF-beta1 causes a significant increase in 
      whole-lung collagen by day 28 after treatment. In contrast, 10(8) and 10(9) pfu 
      cause severe IPF in 4 days, whereas 10(7) and 5 x 10(7) are intermediate for all 
      parameters studied, i.e. TGF-beta protein, inflammatory cells, cell 
      proliferation, pro-alpha 1(I) collagen gene expression and whole-lung collagen 
      accumulation, and expression of growth factors such as TGF-beta1, TNF-alpha and 
      PDGF-A and -B. Interestingly enough, TGF-beta1, as a potent blocker of epithelial 
      cell proliferation, appears to suppress airway epithelial cell growth that would 
      be expected during the inflammatory phase of IPF. Thus, this model system helps 
      us to understand some quantitative aspects of TGF-beta1 biological activity and 
      allows us to manipulate this potent factor as a mediator of interstitial 
      fibrogenesis.

TI  - The role of gp130/IL-6 cytokines in the development of pulmonary fibrosis: 
      critical determinants of disease susceptibility and progression?
PG  - 327-38
AB  - Cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis (CFA), also known as idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF), is the end stage of a heterogeneous group of disorders in which 
      the deposition of excessive amounts of collagen results in the loss of lung 
      function and premature death. The molecular mechanisms underlying the disease are 
      unknown. Accordingly, there is much debate as to whether pulmonary fibrosis is 
      the end result of (1) a chronic inflammatory process or (2) a disturbance in 
      normal epithelium-fibroblast cross talk, or both. In addition, it appears 
      increasingly likely that there is a genetic component in the development of 
      pulmonary fibrosis. The IL-6 cytokine family is a group of pleiotropic mediators 
      produced by a variety of cells in response to a inflammatory stimuli. These 
      cytokines are grouped together on the basis of weak structural homology, 
      overlapping functions, and shared use of the transmembrane glycoprotein 
      beta-subunit gp130 as part of their multimeric receptor complexes. Activation of 
      these receptor complexes results in the recruitment and phosphorylation of 
      specific transcription factors. In addition, membrane-proximal tyrosine residues 
      act as docking sites for molecules involved in the activation of extracellular 
      signal-related kinase (ERK). However, studies in genetically engineered mice that 
      overexpress members of this family have shown that while overlapping biological 
      activities exist, there are effects specific to individual cytokines. Data from 
      both human and animal studies are now emerging to suggest that members of this 
      cytokine family play an important role in the pathogenesis of fibroproliferative 
      diseases and thus represent a novel group of cytokines implicated in pulmonary 
      fibrosis. Importantly, manipulation of signaling pathways activated by these 
      cytokines may suppress fibrosis but leave innate cellular mechanisms necessary 
      for host defense largely untouched. This may provide guides for the development 
      of novel pharmacological treatment for fibroproliferative diseases.

TI  - Specific gene expression and therapy for pancreatic cancer using the cytosine 
      deaminase gene directed by the rat insulin promoter.
PG  - 98-108; discussion 106-8
AB  - Suicide gene therapy has been shown to be an effective means of destroying 
      pancreatic cancer cells, but cell-specific delivery of the gene is required to 
      limit host toxicity. The objective of this study is to determine whether the rat 
      insulin promoter (RIP) will permit cell-specific gene delivery and subsequent 
      cell death in human pancreatic cancer cells. The RIP DNA was amplified using 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the purified fragment was inserted into 
      pCR-Blunt II-TOPO plasmid at the SpeI site, which contains the coding sequence of 
      yeast cytosine deaminase (CD). Transfection assays were carried out using both 
      RIP-lacZ and RIP-CD DNA constructs in two human pancreatic cancer cell lines, 
      PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2. Reporter assays using X-gal staining were performed, and 
      the in vitro cytotoxicity was examined in RIP-CD-transfected cells treated with 
      5-flucytosine for 5 days. The expression levels of CD protein in the transfected 
      cells were determined 2 days after transfection by Western blot analysis. The 
      expression levels of insulin promoter factor (IPF-1/PDX-1) in these human 
      pancreatic cell lines, as well as in freshly isolated human pancreatic cancer 
      specimens, were determined using in situ immunohistochemistry analysis. After 
      transfection with RIP-lacZ, only PANC-1 cells, but not MIA PaCa-2 cells, were 
      positive for RIP-lacZ expression, indicating that RIP-directed reporter gene 
      expression occurred only in PANC-1 cells. After transfection with RIP-CD and 
      treatment with 5-flucytosine, PANC-1 cells had a significantly increased cell 
      death rate compared with that of MIA PaCa-2 cells, suggesting that RIP-directed 
      suicide gene expression occurred only in PANC-1 cells. Western blot analysis 
      demonstrated that only PANC-1 cells were able to express the CD protein and that 
      significantly increased levels of PDX-1 were found in PANC-1 but not in Mia 
      PaCa-2 cells. In situ immunohistochemical analysis of both cell lines showed that 
      PDX-1 was only expressed in the nuclei of PANC-1 cells and not in MIA PaCa-2 
      cells. Furthermore, two freshly isolated human pancreatic cancer specimens had 
      significantly increased levels of PDX-1. The RIP is activated in PANC-1 cells, 
      but not in Mia PaCa-2 cells, and the mechanism of activation is via PDX-1. 
      Pancreatic cancer-specific cytotoxicity can be achieved with the use of RIP-CD 
      and 5-flucytosine treatment in vitro. Significantly increased levels of PDX-1 
      have been found in human pancreatic cancer specimens. These results suggest that 
      RIP could be used for cell-specific suicide gene therapy to target human 
      pancreatic tumors.

TI  - New classifications and concepts of pathogenesis and management of diffuse 
      interstitial lung diseases.
PG  - 337-50
AB  - The diffuse interstitial lung diseases (ILD) are a very complex group of 
      disorders, of which more than 200 specific disease entities are known. All ILD 
      are characterized by a homogenous or heterogenous affection of the lung 
      parenchyma. In recent years there was a renewed interest in the ILD because new 
      concepts have been developed on aetiologic influences, on pathogenetic mechanisms 
      (of inflammation versus active fibrosis) and on genetic susceptibility and 
      consequently on the diagnostic-therapeutic management. Yet, there remain many 
      questions still, e.g. concerning the exact incidence and prevalence of the 
      majority of these diseases and concerning the genetic aspects. More specifically 
      much research has been carried out on the important group of "idiopathic 
      interstitial pneumonias" (IIP) and in particular on "idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis" (IPF). Recently several international consensus reports have been 
      published with guidelines on the histologic and clinical definitions and on the 
      classification and the diagnostic-therapeutic management.

TI  - Pancreas duodenum homeobox-1 transcriptional activation requires interactions 
      with p300.
PG  - 2918-28
AB  - The homeodomain transcription factor, pancreas duodenum homeobox (PDX)-1, is 
      essential for pancreas development, insulin production, and glucose homeostasis. 
      Mutations in pdx-1(ipf-1) are associated both with maturity-onset diabetes of the 
      young and type 2 diabetes. PDX-1 interacts with multiple transcription factors 
      and coregulators, including the coactivator p300, to activate the transcription 
      of the insulin gene and other target genes within pancreatic beta-cells. In 
      characterizing the protein-protein interactions of PDX-1 and p300, we identified 
      mutations in PDX-1 that disrupt its function and are associated with increased or 
      decreased interactions with p300. Several mutant PDX-1 proteins that are 
      associated with heritable forms of diabetes in humans, in particular the mutant 
      P63fsdelC, exhibited increased binding to a carboxy-terminal segment of p300 in 
      the setting of decreased DNA-binding activities, suggesting that sequestration of 
      p300 by mutant PDX-1 proteins may be an additional mechanism by which insulin 
      gene expression is reduced in heterozygous carriers of pdx-1(ipf-1) mutations. 
      The introduction of the point mutations S66A/Y68A in the highly conserved 
      amino-terminal PDX-1 transactivation domain reduced the ability of PDX-1 to 
      interact with p300, substantially diminished the transcriptional activation of 
      PDX-1, and reduced the synergistic activation of glucose-responsive insulin 
      promoter enhancer sequences by PDX-1, E12, and E47. We propose that interactions 
      of PDX-1 with p300 are required for the transcriptional activation of PDX-1 
      target genes. Impairment of interactions between PDX-1 and p300 in pancreatic 
      beta-cells may limit insulin production and lead to the development of diabetes.

TI  - Connective tissue growth factor expression and induction by transforming growth 
      factor-beta is abrogated by simvastatin via a Rho signaling mechanism.
PG  - L1323-32
AB  - Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a potent profibrotic mediator, acts 
      downstream and in concert with transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta to drive 
      fibrogenesis. Significant upregulation of CTGF has been reported in fibrogenic 
      diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and is partly 
      responsible for associated excessive fibroblast proliferation and extracellular 
      matrix deposition, but no effective therapy exists for averting such fibrogeneic 
      events. Simvastatin has reported putative antifibrotic actions in renal 
      fibroblasts; this study explores such actions on human IPF-derived and normal 
      lung fibroblasts and examines associated driving mechanisms. Simvastatin reduces 
      basal CTGF gene and protein expression in all fibroblast lines, overriding 
      TGF-beta induction through inhibition of the cholesterol synthesis pathway. 
      Signaling pathways driving simvastatin's effects on CTGF/TGF-beta interaction 
      were evaluated using transient reporter transfection of a CTGF promoter 
      construct. Inhibition of CTGF promoter activity by simvastatin was most marked at 
      10 muM concentration, reducing activity by 76.2 and 51.8% over 
      TGF-beta-stimulated cultures in IPF and normal fibroblasts, respectively. We also 
      show that geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP), but not farnesylpyrophosphate, 
      induces CTGF promoter activity following simvastatin inhibition by 55.3 and 31.1% 
      over GGPP-negative cultures in IMR90 and IPF-derived fibroblasts, respectively, 
      implicating small GTPase Rho involvement rather than Ras in these effects. 
      Indeed, the specific Rho inhibitor C3 exotoxin significantly (P < 0.05) 
      suppressed TGF-beta-induced CTGF promoter activity in transfected lung 
      fibroblasts, a finding further supported by transfection of dominant-negative and 
      constitutively active RhoA constructs, thus demonstrating that simvastatin 
      through a Rho signaling mechanism in lung fibroblasts can modulate CTGF 
      expression and interaction with TGF-beta.

TI  - Interstitial lung diseases--where we started from and are now going.
PG  - 5-12
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Research into mechanisms causing interstitial lung diseases 
      (ILD) began 35 years ago with the advent of cellular immunology and techniques to 
      sample airways for biologic materials. After an analysis of lung research 
      programs by the then National Heart and Lung Institute in 1972 identified as a 
      priority the study of fibrotic and immunologic lung diseases, this began in the 
      Pulmonary Branch (1974) of the Institute's intramural program. The Division of 
      Lung Diseases initiated extramural research support also. ILD research developed 
      quickly at many centers in the US and throughout the world. This review focuses 
      on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and highlights some of the initial 
      research from the Pulmonary Branch. RECENT RESEARCH PARADIGM: In the 1990s 
      research emphasis changed from a focus on inflammation to alveolar epithelial 
      injury, fibrogenesis in fibroblastic foci, myofibroblast function, cytokine 
      secretion and disordered matrix remodeling. More precise classification of ILD 
      was advocated, especially for IPF. New strategies for therapy of IPF followed, 
      including anti-fibrotic agents and interferon gamma treatment. However, therapy 
      is still not sufficiently effective. Much is still left to do. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: 
      The NHLBI research support continues for ILD, especially IPF. Current programs 
      include: searching for new molecular therapeutic targets; establishing of a 
      clinical network for IPF patients to assess combinations of therapy and new 
      agents as appropriate; identifying genomic and genetic susceptibility factors; 
      and creating a repository for lung tissue and biologic samples to aid 
      investigators.

TI  - Up-regulation and profibrotic role of osteopontin in human idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis.
PG  - e251
LID - e251
AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and lethal 
      disorder characterized by fibroproliferation and excessive accumulation of 
      extracellular matrix in the lung. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using oligonucleotide 
      arrays, we identified osteopontin as one of the genes that significantly 
      distinguishes IPF from normal lungs. Osteopontin was localized to alveolar 
      epithelial cells in IPF lungs and was also significantly elevated in 
      bronchoalveolar lavage from IPF patients. To study the fibrosis-relevant effects 
      of osteopontin we stimulated primary human lung fibroblasts and alveolar 
      epithelial cells (A549) with recombinant osteopontin. Osteopontin induced a 
      significant increase of migration and proliferation in both fibroblasts and 
      epithelial cells. Epithelial growth was inhibited by the pentapeptide 
      Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (GRGDS) and antibody to CD44, while fibroproliferation was 
      inhibited by GRGDS and antibody to alphavbeta3 integrin. Fibroblast and 
      epithelial cell migration were inhibited by GRGDS, anti-CD44, and 
      anti-alphavbeta3. In fibroblasts, osteopontin up-regulated tissue inhibitor of 
      metalloprotease-1 and type I collagen, and down-regulated matrix 
      metalloprotease-1 (MMP-1) expression, while in A549 cells it caused up-regulation 
      of MMP-7. In human IPF lungs, osteopontin colocalized with MMP-7 in alveolar 
      epithelial cells, and application of weakest link statistical models to 
      microarray data suggested a significant interaction between osteopontin and 
      MMP-7. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide a potential mechanism by which 
      osteopontin secreted from the alveolar epithelium may exert a profibrotic effect 
      in IPF lungs and highlight osteopontin as a potential target for therapeutic 
      intervention in this incurable disease.

TI  - Gene expression profiles distinguish idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis from 
      hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
PG  - 188-98
AB  - RATIONALE: Many of the interstitial lung diseases represent a diagnostic and 
      therapeutic challenge because their clinical and even histologic features are 
      often nonspecific. Likewise, the transcriptional signatures of most of them are 
      unknown. OBJECTIVE: To compare the gene expression patterns from patients with 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), and 
      nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) using custom oligonucleotide 
      microarrays. METHODS: We profiled lung biopsies from 15 patients with IPF, 12 
      with HP, and eight with NSIP. Labeled complementary ribonucleic acid was 
      hybridized to a custom Affymetrix oligonucleotide DNA microarray using standard 
      Affymetrix protocols. The custom array, Hu03, contained 59,619 probe sets 
      representing an estimated 46,000 gene clusters. RESULTS: We identified 
      statistically significant gene expression signatures that characterize HP and 
      IPF. The HP gene expression signature was enriched for genes that are 
      functionally associated with inflammation, T-cell activation, and immune 
      responses, whereas the IPF signature was characterized by the expression of 
      tissue remodeling, epithelial, and myofibroblast genes. We then compared these 
      gene expression signatures to classify NSIP, a histologic pattern that is often 
      difficult to differentiate consistently from HP and IPF. Two cases exhibited an 
      IPF-like gene expression, another one could be more properly classified as HP, 
      whereas others did not resemble HP or IPF, suggesting that they may represent 
      idiopathic NSIP. CONCLUSIONS: Our results underscore the value of gene expression 
      signatures to classify the interstitial lung diseases and to understand 
      pathogenic mechanisms, and suggest new ways to improve the diagnosis and 
      treatment of patients with these diseases.

TI  - Negative regulation of myofibroblast differentiation by PTEN (Phosphatase and 
      Tensin Homolog Deleted on chromosome 10).
PG  - 112-21
AB  - RATIONALE: Myofibroblasts are primary effector cells in idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF). Defining mechanisms of myofibroblast differentiation may be 
      critical to the development of novel therapeutic agents. OBJECTIVE: To show that 
      myofibroblast differentiation is regulated by phosphatase and tensin homolog 
      deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) activity in vivo, and to identify a potential 
      mechanism by which this occurs. METHODS: We used tissue sections of surgical lung 
      biopsies from patients with IPF to localize expression of PTEN and alpha-smooth 
      muscle actin (alpha-SMA). We used cell culture of pten(-/-) and wild-type 
      fibroblasts, as well as adenoviral strategies and pharmacologic inhibitors, to 
      determine the mechanism by which PTEN inhibits alpha-SMA, fibroblast 
      proliferation, and collagen production. RESULTS: In human lung specimens of IPF, 
      myofibroblasts within fibroblastic foci demonstrated diminished PTEN expression. 
      Furthermore, inhibition of PTEN in mice worsened bleomycin-induced fibrosis. In 
      pten(-/-) fibroblasts, and in normal fibroblasts in which PTEN was inhibited, 
      alpha-SMA, proliferation, and collagen production was upregulated. Addition of 
      transforming growth factor-beta to wild-type cells, but not pten(-/-) cells, 
      resulted in increased alpha-SMA expression in a time-dependent fashion. In 
      pten(-/-) cells, reconstitution of PTEN decreased alpha-SMA expression, 
      proliferation, and collagen production, whereas overexpression of PTEN in 
      wild-type cells inhibited transforming growth factor-beta-induced myofibroblast 
      differentiation. It was observed that both the protein and lipid phosphatase 
      actions of PTEN were capable of modulating the myofibroblast phenotype. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that in IPF, myofibroblasts have diminished 
      PTEN expression. Inhibition of PTEN in vivo promotes fibrosis, and PTEN inhibits 
      myofibroblast differentiation in vitro.

TI  - Phosphorylation marks IPF1/PDX1 protein for degradation by glycogen synthase 
      kinase 3-dependent mechanisms.
PG  - 6395-403
AB  - The transcription factor IPF1/PDX1 plays a crucial role in both pancreas 
      development and maintenance of beta-cell function. Targeted disruption of this 
      transcription factor in beta-cells leads to diabetes, whereas reduced expression 
      levels affect insulin expression and secretion. Therefore, it is essential to 
      determine molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of this key 
      transcription factor on mRNA levels and, most importantly, on protein levels. 
      Here we show that a minor portion of IPF1/PDX1 is phosphorylated on serine 61 
      and/or serine 66 in pancreatic beta-cells. This phosphorylated form of IPF1/PDX1 
      preferentially accumulates following proteasome inhibition, an effect that is 
      prevented by inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) activity. Oxidative 
      stress, which is associated with the diabetic state, (i) increases IPF1/PDX1 
      Ser61 and/or Ser66 phosphorylation and (ii) increases the degradation rate and 
      decreases the half-life of IPF-1/PDX-1 protein. In addition, we provide evidence 
      that GSK3 activity participates in oxidative stress-induced effects on 
      beta-cells. Thus, this current study uncovers a new mechanism that might 
      contribute to diminished levels of IPF1/PDX1 protein and beta-cell dysfunction 
      during the progression of diabetes.

TI  - Discoidin domain receptor 1 contributes to the survival of lung fibroblast in 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 866-77
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), characterized by fibroblast proliferation 
      and accumulation of extracellular matrix, including collagen, is a chronic 
      progressive disorder that results in lung remodeling and fibrosis. However, the 
      cellular mechanisms that may make fibroblasts resistant to apoptosis have not 
      been completely elucidated. Discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1), a receptor 
      tyrosine kinase whose ligand is collagen, is expressed in vivo and contributes in 
      vitro to leukocyte differentiation and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation, 
      which may play an important role in fibroblast survival. In this study, we 
      examined in vivo and in vitro DDR1 expression and its role in cell survival using 
      fibroblasts obtained from IPF and non-IPF patients. Immunohistochemically, 
      fibroblasts present in fibroblastic foci expressed endogenous DDR1. The DDR1 
      expression level was significantly higher in fibroblasts from IPF patients, and 
      the predominant isoform was DDR1b. In IPF patients, DDR1 activation in 
      fibroblasts inhibited Fas ligand-induced apoptosis and resulted in NF-kappaB 
      nuclear translocation. Suppression of DDR1 expression in fibroblasts by siRNA 
      abolished these effects, and an NF-kappaB inhibitor abrogated the anti-apoptotic 
      effect of DDR1 activation. We propose that DDR1 contributes to fibroblast 
      survival in the tissue microenvironment of IPF and that DDR1 up-regulation may 
      occur in other fibroproliferative lung diseases as well.

TI  - Characterization of tau pathologies in gray and white matter of Guam 
      parkinsonism-dementia complex.
PG  - 401-12
AB  - Guam parkinsonism-dementia complex (PDC) is a neurodegenerative tauopathy in 
      ethnic Chamorro residents of the Mariana Islands that manifests clinically with 
      parkinsonism as well as dementia and is characterized neuropathologically by 
      prominent cortical neuron loss in association with extensive telencephalic 
      neurofibrillary tau pathology. To further characterize cortical gray and white 
      matter tau, alpha-synuclein and lipid peroxidation pathologies in Guam PDC, we 
      examined the brains of 17 Chamorro PDC and control subjects using biochemical and 
      immunohistological techniques. We observed insoluble tau pathology in both gray 
      and white matter of PDC and Guam control cases, with frontal and temporal lobes 
      being most severely affected. Using phosphorylation dependent anti-tau 
      antibodies, abundant tau inclusions were detected by immunohistochemistry in both 
      neuronal and glial cells of the neocortex, while less alpha-synuclein pathology 
      was observed in more limited brain regions. Further, in sharp contrast to 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), levels of the lipid peroxidation product 8, 
      12-iso-iPF(2alpha)-VI isoprostane were not elevated in Guam PDC brains relative 
      to controls. Thus, although the tau pathologies of Guam PDC share similarities 
      with AD, the composite Guam PDC neuropathology profile of tau, alpha-synuclein 
      and 8, 12-iso-iPF(2alpha)-VI isoprostane reported here more closely resembles 
      that seen in other tauopathies including frontotemporal dementias (FTDs), which 
      may imply that Guam PDC and FTD tauopathies share underlying mechanisms of 
      neurodegeneration.

TI  - Activation of alveolar macrophages via the alternative pathway in 
      herpesvirus-induced lung fibrosis.
PG  - 466-73
AB  - The etiology of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is unknown. Because viral 
      pathogenesis of IPF has been suggested, we have established a murine model of 
      progressive pulmonary fibrosis by infecting IFN-gammaR-deficient mice 
      (IFN-gammaR(-/-)) with the murine gamma-herpesvirus 68. Because alveolar 
      macrophages in humans with IPF have been implicated in driving the profibrotic 
      response, we studied their role in our model. Chronic herpesvirus infection of 
      the lung was associated with recruitment of alveolar macrophages to areas with 
      epithelial hyperplasia and fibrosis in infected lungs. Using 
      immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and RT-PCR techniques, we demonstrated that 
      recruited alveolar macrophages showed high levels of expression of the proteins 
      Ym1/2, FIZZ1 (found in inflammatory zone 1), insulin-like growth factor-1, and 
      arginase I, and also active transcription of fibronectin, indicative of 
      activation of macrophages by an alternative pathway. Arginase I expression was 
      also evident in interstitial fibroblasts, and increased arginase activity was 
      found in lungs of infected animals. Lung tissue from patients with IPF showed 
      increased expression of arginase I in epithelial cells, fibroblast foci, and 
      alveolar macrophages compared with normal lung. These results suggest that 
      virus-induced upregulation of arginase I could be a mechanism driving lung 
      fibrogenesis.

TI  - Targeting genes for treatment in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: challenges and 
      opportunities, promises and pitfalls.
PG  - 389-93
AB  - The currently accepted approach to treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
      (IPF) is based on the assumption that it is a chronic inflammatory disease, and 
      most available antiinflammatory drugs target numerous biological processes 
      involving multiple genes, but are not often beneficial. More novel therapeutic 
      strategies take recent findings about the underlying molecular mechanisms of 
      fibrogenesis into account, and ongoing and as yet unpublished clinical trials in 
      IPF aim to block single gene targets believed to play major roles in disease 
      progression. Characterization of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of 
      IPF has largely come from the use of animal disease models in rodents. Most data 
      suggest, from among the different factors, a prominent role for the transforming 
      growth factor (TGF)-beta1 and platelet-derived growth factor pathways. 
      Inflammation is a critical element of the initiation of fibrosis and data 
      indicate that the Smad pathway is a necessary link to fibrosis through TGF-beta 
      and Smad3 signaling, which introduces matrix regulation as a new target for 
      therapeutic intervention. Regardless, gene targeted therapy has numerous pitfalls 
      that have to be addressed before we see a real therapeutic advance.

TI  - RhoA signaling modulates cyclin D1 expression in human lung fibroblasts; 
      implications for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 88
AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a debilitating disease 
      characterized by exaggerated extracellular matrix deposition and aggressive lung 
      structural remodeling. Disease pathogenesis is driven by fibroblastic foci 
      formation, consequent on growth factor overexpression and myofibroblast 
      proliferation. We have previously shown that both CTGF overexpression and 
      myofibroblast formation in IPF cell lines are dependent on RhoA signaling. As 
      RhoA-mediated regulation is also involved in cell cycle progression, we 
      hypothesise that this pathway is key to lung fibroblast turnover through 
      modulation of cyclin D1 kinetic expression. METHODS: Cyclin D1 expression was 
      compared in primary IPF patient-derived fibroblasts and equivalent normal control 
      cells. Quantitative real time PCR was employed to examine relative expression 
      levels of cyclin D1 mRNA; protein expression was confirmed by western blotting. 
      Effects of Rho signaling were investigated using transient transfection of 
      constitutively active and dominant negative RhoA constructs as well as 
      pharmacological inhibitors. Cellular proliferation of lung fibroblasts was 
      determined by BrdU incorporation ELISA. To further explore RhoA regulation of 
      cyclin D1 in lung fibroblasts and associated cell cycle progression, an 
      established Rho inhibitor, Simvastatin, was incorporated in our studies. RESULTS: 
      Cyclin D1 expression was upregulated in IPF compared to normal lung fibroblasts 
      under exponential growth conditions (p < 0.05). Serum deprivation inhibited 
      cyclin D1 expression, which was restored following treatment with fibrogenic 
      growth factors (TGF-beta1 and CTGF). RhoA inhibition, using a dominant negative 
      mutant and a pharmacological inhibitor (C3 exotoxin), suppressed levels of cyclin 
      D1 mRNA and protein in IPF fibroblasts, with significant abrogation of cell 
      turnover (p < 0.05). Furthermore, Simvastatin dose-dependently inhibited 
      fibroblast cyclin D1 gene and protein expression, inducing G1 cell cycle arrest. 
      Similar trends were observed in control experiments using normal lung 
      fibroblasts, though exhibited responses were lower in magnitude. CONCLUSION: 
      These findings report for the first time that cyclin D1 expression is deregulated 
      in IPF through a RhoA dependent mechanism that influences lung fibroblast 
      proliferation. This potentially unravels new molecular targets for future 
      anti-IPF strategies; accordingly, Simvastatin inhibition of Rho-mediated cyclin 
      D1 expression in IPF fibroblasts merits further exploitation.

TI  - Extracellular superoxide dismutase has a highly specific localization in 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis/usual interstitial pneumonia.
PG  - 66-74
AB  - AIMS: Recent studies suggest the importance of oxidant stress in the progression 
      of pulmonary fibrosis. The aim of this study was to investigate extracellular 
      superoxide dismutase (ECSOD), the major antioxidant enzyme of the extracellular 
      matrix of human lung, in biopsy-proven idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) 
      related to usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). METHODS AND RESULTS: Fibrotic 
      areas and fibroblastic foci in UIP lungs were notable for absence of ECSOD by 
      immunohistochemistry. Western blotting showed significantly lowered 
      immunoreactivity of ECSOD in fibrotic compared with non-fibrotic areas of the 
      diseased lung. The only cell type that showed intense ECSOD positivity in UIP was 
      the interstitial mast cell. In order to investigate the mechanism for ECSOD 
      depletion in fibrotic areas, alveolar epithelial cells were exposed to tumour 
      necrosis factor-alpha and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1; TGF-beta 
      suggested a trend towards decreased synthesis. Patients with UIP were also 
      assessed to determine whether this disease is associated with a naturally 
      occurring mutation in ECSOD (Arg213Gly) which leads to a loss of tissue binding 
      of ECSOD. No significant differences could be found in the allele or genotype 
      frequencies of this polymorphism between 63 UIP patients and 61 control subjects. 
      CONCLUSION: Overall, consistent with several other antioxidant enzymes, ECSOD is 
      very low in fibrotic areas of UIP, which may further increase the oxidant burden 
      in this disease.

TI  - Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 is up-regulated by transforming growth 
      factor-beta1 in vitro and expressed in fibroblastic foci in vivo in idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 201-14
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by fibroblast expansion and 
      extracellular matrix accumulation. However, the mechanisms involved in matrix 
      remodeling have not been elucidated. In this study, the authors aimed to evaluate 
      the expression of the tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs) in 
      human fibroblasts and whole tissues from IPF and normal lungs. They also 
      determined the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in TIMP3 
      expression. TIMP1, TIMP2, and TIMP3 were highly expressed in lung fibroblasts. 
      Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, a profibrotic mediator, induced strong 
      up-regulation of TIMP3 at the mRNA and protein levels. The authors examined 
      whether the MAPK pathway was involved in TGF-beta1-induced TIMP3 expression. 
      TGF-beta1 induced the phosphorylation of p38 and extracellular signal-regulated 
      kinase (ERK)1/2. Biochemical blockade of p38 by SB203580, but not of the ERK MAPK 
      pathway, inhibited the effect of this factor. The effect was also blocked by the 
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein and by antagonizing TGF-beta1 receptor type I 
      (activin-linked kinase [ALK5]). In IPF tissues TIMP3 gene expression was 
      significantly increased and the protein was localized to fibroblastic foci and 
      extracellular matrix. Our findings suggest that TGF-beta1-induced TIMP3 may be an 
      important mediator in lung fibrogenesis.

TI  - Microarray identifies ADAM family members as key responders to TGF-beta1 in 
      alveolar epithelial cells.
PG  - 114
AB  - The molecular mechanisms of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) remain elusive. 
      Transforming Growth Factor beta 1(TGF-beta1) is a key effector cytokine in the 
      development of lung fibrosis. We used microarray and computational biology 
      strategies to identify genes whose expression is significantly altered in 
      alveolar epithelial cells (A549) in response to TGF-beta1, IL-4 and IL-13 and 
      Epstein Barr virus. A549 cells were exposed to 10 ng/ml TGF-beta1, IL-4 and IL-13 
      at serial time points. Total RNA was used for hybridisation to Affymetrix Human 
      Genome U133A microarrays. Each in vitro time-point was studied in duplicate and 
      an average RMA value computed. Expression data for each time point was compared 
      to control and a signal log ratio of 0.6 or greater taken to identify significant 
      differential regulation. Using normalised RMA values and unsupervised Average 
      Linkage Hierarchical Cluster Analysis, a list of 312 extracellular matrix (ECM) 
      proteins or modulators of matrix turnover was curated via Onto-Compare and 
      Gene-Ontology (GO) databases for baited cluster analysis of ECM associated genes. 
      Interrogation of the dataset using ontological classification focused cluster 
      analysis revealed coordinate differential expression of a large cohort of 
      extracellular matrix associated genes. Of this grouping members of the ADAM (A 
      disintegrin and Metalloproteinase domain containing) family of genes were 
      differentially expressed. ADAM gene expression was also identified in EBV 
      infected A549 cells as well as IL-13 and IL-4 stimulated cells. We probed 
      pathologenomic activities (activation and functional activity) of ADAM19 and 
      ADAMTS9 using siRNA and collagen assays. Knockdown of these genes resulted in 
      diminished production of collagen in A549 cells exposed to TGF-beta1, suggesting 
      a potential role for these molecules in ECM accumulation in IPF.

TI  - Smooth muscle alpha-actin expression and myofibroblast differentiation by TGFbeta 
      are dependent upon MK2.
PG  - 1581-92
AB  - Fibroblasts play a major role in processes such as wound repair, scarring, and 
      fibrosis. Differentiation into myofibroblasts, characterized by upregulation of 
      smooth muscle alpha-actin (smalpha) in response to profibrotic agents such as 
      TGFbeta is believed to be an important step in fibrosis. Therefore, elucidating 
      mechanisms of myofibroblast differentiation might reveal novel targets in 
      treating diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). MK2 is a kinase 
      substrate of p38 MAP kinase that mediates some effects of p38 activation on the 
      actin cytoskeleton. Using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) from MK2 knockout 
      (MK2(-/-)) mice, we demonstrate that disrupting expression of MK2 expression 
      reduces filamentous actin and stress fibers. It also causes MK2(-/-) MEF to 
      express less smalpha than their corresponding wild-type (WT) MEF at baseline and 
      in response to TGFbeta. Furthermore, TGFbeta causes downregulation of smalpha in 
      MK2(-/-) MEF, instead of upregulation observed in WT MEF. Expression of other 
      fibroblast markers, such as collagen, is not altered in MK2(-/-) MEF. Our results 
      further suggest that downregulation of smalpha in MK2(-/-) MEF is not due to lack 
      of activation of serum responsive promoter elements, but probably due to reduced 
      smalpha message stability in these cells. These results indicate that MK2 plays a 
      key role in regulation of smalpha expression, and that targeting MK2 might 
      present a therapeutic approach in managing conditions such as pulmonary fibrosis.

TI  - Genetic mechanisms of susceptibility to oxidative lung injury in mice.
PG  - 433-45
AB  - Genetic background is a known predisposing risk factor for many acute and chronic 
      pulmonary disorders and responses to environmental oxidants. Variation in lung 
      injury responses to oxidative stimuli such as ozone, particles, hyperoxia, and 
      chemotherapeutic agents between genetically standardized inbred mouse strains has 
      been demonstrated. In this review, we discuss quantitative trait loci (QTLs) 
      which contain candidate genes that confer differential susceptibility to 
      oxidative stimuli between strains in mouse models of airway toxicity and disease. 
      We addressed multiple inflammatory, immunity, and antioxidant genes identified as 
      candidate genetic determinants following these strategies, which include tumor 
      necrosis factor (Tnf), toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr4), and the transcription factor 
      NF-E2, related factor 2 (Nrf2). Mice with targeted deletion of these and related 
      genes have provided initial proof of concept for their importance in the 
      respective models. Interestingly, a few regions of the genome appear to have 
      important roles in determining susceptibility to a number of stimuli which may 
      suggest common genetic mechanisms in mice. Though more complete examination of 
      functional association is required, results have potential implications for the 
      role of these candidate genes in the pathogenesis of human pulmonary diseases 
      including asthma, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and emphysema.

TI  - Impairment of alveolar macrophage transcription in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 1151-7
AB  - RATIONALE: Alveolar macrophages are inflammatory cells that may contribute to the 
      pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), which is characterized by 
      excessive alveolar aggregation of cells and extracellular matrix proteins. 
      OBJECTIVES: To identify potential molecular mechanisms of IPF. METHODS: To 
      examine large-scale gene expression, messenger RNA isolated from alveolar 
      macrophages and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from subjects with IPF and 
      normal volunteers was hybridized to cDNA filters. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: 
      We showed that in IPF there is global down-regulation of gene expression in 
      alveolar macrophages but not in blood monocytes. Nuclear run-on and pulse-chase 
      studies showed that alveolar macrophages had significantly reduced transcription 
      (p < 0.01). No significant difference in RNA degradation was found between 
      subjects with IPF and normal volunteers. Western blot analyses revealed that 
      concentrations of transcription factor II-H, a general transcription factor, were 
      significantly lower in alveolar macrophages from subjects with IPF than in those 
      from normal volunteers (p = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: Impaired transcription in IPF is 
      associated with decreased concentrations of transcription factor II-H in alveolar 
      macrophages and may alter the intraalveolar milieu in IPF.

TI  - Thalidomide prevents bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice.
PG  - 708-14
AB  - Pulmonary fibrosis in humans can occur as a result of a large number of 
      conditions. In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), pulmonary function becomes 
      progressively compromised resulting in a high mortality rate. Currently there are 
      no proven effective treatments for IPF. We have recently reported that IL-6 and 
      TGF-beta(1) plays an important role in proliferation and differentiation of lung 
      fibroblasts, and all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) prevented bleomycin-induced lung 
      fibrosis through the inhibition of these cytokines. Thalidomide (Thal) has been 
      used in the treatment of multiple myeloma through the inhibitory effect on 
      IL-6-dependent cell growth and angiogenesis. In this study, we examined the 
      preventive effect of Thal on bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. We 
      performed histological examinations and quantitative measurements of IL-6, 
      TGF-beta(1), collagen type Ialpha1 (COL1A1), vascular endothelial growth factor 
      (VEGF), angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) in bleomycin-treated 
      mouse lung tissues with or without the administration of Thal. Thal 
      histologically ameliorated bleomycin-induced fibrosis in mouse lung tissues. Thal 
      decreased the expressions of IL-6, TGF-beta(1), VEGF, Ang-1 Ang-2, and COL1A1 
      mRNA in mouse lung tissues. In addition, Thal inhibited angiogenesis in the lung. 
      In vitro studies disclosed that Thal reduced 1) production of IL-6, TGF-beta(1), 
      VEGF, Ang-1, and collagen synthesis from human lung fibroblasts, and 2) both 
      IL-6-dependent proliferation and TGF-beta(1)-dependent transdifferentiation of 
      the cells, which could be the mechanism underlying the preventive effect of Thal 
      on pulmonary fibrosis. These data may provide a rationale to explore clinical use 
      of Thal for the prevention of pulmonary fibrosis.

TI  - Acute exacerbations of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 636-43
AB  - The natural history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has been characterized 
      as a steady, predictable decline in lung function over time. Recent evidence 
      suggests that some patients may experience a more precipitous course, with 
      periods of relative stability followed by acute deteriorations in respiratory 
      status. Many of these acute deteriorations are of unknown etiology and have been 
      termed acute exacerbations of IPF. This perspective is the result of an 
      international effort to summarize the current state of knowledge regarding acute 
      exacerbations of IPF. Acute exacerbations of IPF are defined as acute, clinically 
      significant deteriorations of unidentifiable cause in patients with underlying 
      IPF. Proposed diagnostic criteria include subjective worsening over 30 days or 
      less, new bilateral radiographic opacities, and the absence of infection or 
      another identifiable etiology. The potential pathobiological roles of infection, 
      disordered cell biology, coagulation, and genetics are discussed, and future 
      research directions are proposed.

PG  - 1235-44
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a chronic progressive lung disease of 
      unknown etiology, is characterized by the expansion of myofibroblasts and 
      abnormal deposition of extracellular matrix in the lung parenchyma. To elucidate 
      the molecular mechanisms that lead to IPF, we analyzed myofibroblasts established 
      from patients with IPF by oligonucleotide microarrays. Gene expression profiles 
      clearly suggested that lipid peroxidation is enhanced in myofibroblasts, which 
      was confirmed by measuring cellular lipid hydroperoxides. One of the most highly 
      up-regulated proteins in myofibroblasts was selenoprotein P, an antioxidant 
      protein not previously associated with IPF. Subsequent analysis demonstrated that 
      selenoprotein P reduces lipid hydroperoxides and maintains the viability of 
      myofibroblasts. Thus, our results reveal a novel pathophysiologic function of 
      myofibroblasts as a generator of lipid hydroperoxides, and a self-defense 
      mechanism against self-generated oxidative stress.

      fibrosis: clinicopathological correlations.
PG  - 795-802
LID - 10.1136/thx.2007.088583 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive disorder 
      with a poor prognosis. Epithelial instability is a crucial step in the 
      development and progression of the disease, including neoplastic transformation. 
      Few tissue markers for epithelial instability have been reported in IPF. Squamous 
      cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA) is a serine protease inhibitor typically expressed 
      by dysplastic and neoplastic cells of epithelial origin, more often in squamous 
      cell tumours. At present, no information is available on its expression in IPF. 
      METHODS: SCCA and transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) expression in 
      surgical lung biopsies from 22 patients with IPF and 20 control cases was 
      examined. An in vitro study using A549 pneumocytes was also conducted to 
      investigate the relationship between SCCA and TGFbeta expression. SCCA and 
      TGFbeta epithelial expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and reverse 
      transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). SCCA values were correlated with different 
      pathological and clinical parameters. Time course analysis of TGFbeta expression 
      in A549 pneumocytes incubated with different SCCA concentrations was assessed by 
      real time RT-PCR. RESULTS: SCCA was expressed in many metaplastic alveolar 
      epithelial cells in all IPF cases with a mean value of 24.9% while it was seen in 
      only two control patients in up to 5% of metaplastic cells. In patients with IPF, 
      SCCA correlated positively with extension of fibroblastic foci (r = 0.49, p = 
      0.02), expression of TGFbeta (r = 0.78, p<0.0001) and with carbon monoxide 
      transfer factor decline after 9 months of follow-up (r = 0.59, p = 0.01). In 
      vitro experiments showed that incubation of cultured cells with SCCA induced 
      TGFbeta expression, with a peak at 24 h. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide for the 
      first time a potential mechanism by which SCCA secreted from metaplastic 
      epithelial cells may exert a profibrotic effect in IPF. SCCA could be an 
      important biomarker in this incurable disease.

TI  - Endoplasmic reticulum stress in alveolar epithelial cells is prominent in IPF: 
      association with altered surfactant protein processing and herpesvirus infection.
PG  - L1119-26
LID - 10.1152/ajplung.00382.2007 [doi]
AB  - Recent evidence suggests that dysfunctional type II alveolar epithelial cells 
      (AECs) contribute to the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). 
      Based on the hypothesis that disease-causing mutations in surfactant protein C 
      (SFTPC) provide an important paradigm for studying IPF, we investigated a 
      potential mechanism of AEC dysfunction suggested to result from mutant SFTPC 
      expression: induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded 
      protein response (UPR). We evaluated biopsies from 23 IPF patients (including 3 
      family members with L188Q SFTPC mutations, 10 individuals with familial 
      interstitial pneumonia without SFTPC mutations, and 10 individuals with sporadic 
      IPF) and sections from 10 control lungs. After demonstrating UPR activation in 
      cultured A549 cells expressing mutant SFTPC, we identified prominent expression 
      of UPR markers in AECs in the lungs of patients with SFTPC mutation-associated 
      fibrosis. In individuals with familial interstitial pneumonia without SFTPC 
      mutations and patients with sporadic IPF, we also found UPR activation 
      selectively in AECs lining areas of fibrotic remodeling. Because herpesviruses 
      are found frequently in IPF lungs and can induce ER stress, we investigated 
      expression of viral proteins in lung biopsies. Herpesvirus protein expression was 
      found in AECs from 15/23 IPF patients and colocalized with UPR markers in AECs 
      from these patients. ER stress and UPR activation are found in the alveolar 
      epithelium in patients with IPF and could contribute to disease progression. 
      Activation of these pathways may result from altered surfactant protein 
      processing or chronic herpesvirus infection.

TI  - Pathological integrin signaling enhances proliferation of primary lung 
      fibroblasts from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 1659-72
LID - 10.1084/jem.20080001 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a relentlessly progressive lung disease in 
      which fibroblasts accumulate in the alveolar wall within a type I collagen-rich 
      matrix. Although lung fibroblasts derived from patients with IPF display durable 
      pathological alterations in proliferative function, the molecular mechanisms 
      differentiating IPF fibroblasts from their normal counterparts remain unknown. 
      Polymerized type I collagen normally inhibits fibroblast proliferation, providing 
      a physiological mechanism to limit fibroproliferation after tissue injury. We 
      demonstrate that beta1 integrin interaction with polymerized collagen inhibits 
      normal fibroblast proliferation by suppression of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase 
      (PI3K)-Akt-S6K1 signal pathway due to maintenance of high phosphatase activity of 
      the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN). In contrast, IPF 
      fibroblasts eluded this restraint, displaying a pathological pattern of beta1 
      integrin signaling in response to polymerized collagen that leads to aberrant 
      activation of the PI3K-Akt-S6K1 signal pathway caused by inappropriately low PTEN 
      activity. Mice deficient in PTEN showed a prolonged fibroproliferative response 
      after tissue injury, and immunohistochemical analysis of IPF lung tissue 
      demonstrates activation of Akt in cells within fibrotic foci. These results 
      provide direct evidence for defective negative regulation of the proliferative 
      pathway in IPF fibroblasts and support the theory that the pathogenesis of IPF 
      involves an intrinsic fibroblast defect.

AB  - Mechanisms regulating myofibroblastic differentiation of fibroblasts within 
      fibroblastic foci in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remain unclear. 
      Epigenetic processes, including DNA methylation, produce heritable but 
      potentially reversible changes in DNA or its associated proteins and are 
      prominent in development and oncogenesis. We have shown that Thy-1 suppresses 
      myofibroblastic differentiation of lung fibroblasts and that fibroblasts in 
      fibroblastic foci are Thy-1(-). Epigenetic down-regulation of Thy-1 has been 
      demonstrated in cellular transformation and clinical cancer. We hypothesized that 
      epigenetic regulation of Thy-1 affects the lung fibroblast fibrogenic phenotype. 
      RT-PCR, methylation-specific PCR (MSP), and bisulfite genomic sequencing were 
      used to determine the methylation status of the Thy-1 promoter in Thy-1(+) and 
      Thy-1(-) lung fibroblasts, and MSP-in situ hybridization (MSPISH) was performed 
      on fibrotic tissue. Thy-1 gene expression is absent in Thy-1(-) human and rat 
      fibroblasts despite intact Thy-1 genomic DNA. Cytosine-guanine islands in the 
      Thy-1 gene promoter are hypermethylated in Thy-1(-), but not Thy-1(+), 
      fibroblasts. RT-PCR and MSP demonstrate that, in IPF samples in which Thy-1 
      expression is absent, the Thy-1 promoter region is methylated, whereas in lung 
      samples retaining Thy-1 expression, the promoter region is unmethylated. MSPISH 
      confirms methylation of the Thy-1 promoter in fibroblastic foci in IPF. Treatment 
      with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors restores Thy-1 expression in Thy-1(-) 
      fibroblasts. Epigenetic regulation of Thy-1 is a novel and potentially reversible 
      mechanism in fibrosis that may offer the possibility of new therapeutic options.

TI  - The latent form of TGFbeta(1) is induced by TNFalpha through an ERK specific 
      pathway and is activated by asbestos-derived reactive oxygen species in vitro and 
      in vivo.
PG  - 145-9
LID - 10.1080/15476910802085822 [doi]
AB  - Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) and transforming growth factor-beta(1) 
      (TGFbeta(1)) are potent peptide growth factors that are likely to play important 
      roles in the development of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Previously we 
      showed that TNFalpha and TGFbeta(1) are up-regulated in macrophages, epithelial 
      and mesenchymal cells early after exposure to chrysotile asbestos, particularly 
      at sites of fiber deposition in vivo. We also showed that TNFalpha receptor 
      knockout mice are resistant to asbestos-induced fibrosis. Importantly, vectors 
      that over-express TNFalpha cause inflammation and fibrogenesis along with 
      increased TGFbeta(1) production in C57Bl/6 mice. Recently we reported that 
      TNFalpha activates the extracellular regulated kinase pathway in fibroblasts 
      leading to a 200-400% increase in TGFbeta(1) mRNA and protein. The mechanism of 
      TNFalpha induction of TGFbeta(1) expression appears to be complex, involving both 
      transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. In asbestos-exposed animals, 
      this TGFbeta(1) is produced on alveolar surfaces in a latent form (controlled by 
      binding of a latent associated peptide [LAP]) that must be activated for the 
      TGFbeta(1) to bind to its receptors and induce its multiple biological effects. 
      Thus, we recently reported that, in vitro, reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived 
      from chrysotile and crocidolite asbestos activate TGFbeta(1) by oxidation of the 
      LAP. Now, in preliminary findings, we have shown that over-expression of latent 
      TGFbeta(1) prior to asbestos exposure of fibrogenic-resistant TNFalpha receptor 
      knockout mice produces asbestos lesions with the same severity as seen in normal 
      C57/Bl6 mice. This finding plus the demonstration of increased amounts of 
      TGFbeta(1), increased Smad activation and amelioration of the developing disease 
      by treating the mice with an anti-oxidant all support the concept that, in vivo, 
      latent TGFbeta(1) is activated by asbestos-generated oxygen radicals and 
      consequently mediates at least a component of the consequent fibrogenesis. Taken 
      together, these findings support the postulate that TNFalpha controls 
      fibrogenesis by regulating TGFbeta(1) expression and that one mechanism through 
      which ROS induce lung fibrosis is by activating latent TGFbeta(1).

TI  - The homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 regulates insulin promoter 
      factor-1/pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1 transcriptional activity.
PG  - 87-97
LID - 10.1210/en.2007-0865 [doi]
AB  - The homeodomain transcription factor insulin promoter factor (IPF)-1/pancreatic 
      duodenal homeobox (PDX)-1 plays a crucial role in both pancreas development and 
      maintenance of beta-cell function. Targeted disruption of the Ipf1/Pdx1 gene in 
      beta-cells of mice leads to overt diabetes and reduced Ipf1/Pdx1 gene expression 
      results in decreased insulin expression and secretion. In humans, mutations in 
      the IPF1 gene have been linked to diabetes. Hence, the identification of 
      molecular mechanisms regulating the transcriptional activity of this key 
      transcription factor is of great interest. Herein we analyzed 
      homeodomain-interacting protein kinase (Hipk) 2 expression in the embryonic and 
      adult pancreas by in situ hybridization and RT-PCR. Moreover, we functionally 
      characterized the role of HIPK2 in regulating IPF1/PDX1 transcriptional activity 
      by performing transient transfection experiments and RNA interference. We show 
      that Hipk2 is expressed in the developing pancreatic epithelium from embryonic d 
      12-15 but that the expression becomes preferentially confined to pancreatic 
      endocrine cells at later developmental stages. Moreover, we show that HIPK2 
      positively influences IPF1/PDX1 transcriptional activity and that the kinase 
      activity of HIPK2 is required for this effect. We also demonstrate that HIPK2 
      directly phosphorylates the C-terminal portion of IPF1/PDX1. Taken together, our 
      data provide evidence for a new mechanism by which IPF1/PDX1 transcriptional 
      activity, and thus possibly pancreas development and/or beta-cell function, is 
      regulated.

TI  - Pulmonary epithelium is a prominent source of proteinase-activated 
      receptor-1-inducible CCL2 in pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 414-25
LID - 10.1164/rccm.200712-1827OC [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Studies in patients and experimental animals provide compelling 
      evidence of the involvement of the major thrombin receptor, proteinase-activated 
      receptor-1 (PAR(1)), and the potent chemokine, chemokine (CC motif) ligand-2 
      (CCL2)/monocyte chemotactic protein-1, in the pathogenesis of idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). PAR(1) knockout mice are protected from 
      bleomycin-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis and this protection is 
      associated with marked attenuation in CCL2 induction. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this 
      study was to determine which cell types represent the major source of 
      PAR(1)-inducible CCL2 in the fibrotic lung. METHODS: Using immunohistochemistry 
      and dual immunofluorescence, we examined PAR(1) and CCL2 expression in the 
      bleomycin model and human IPF lung. PAR(1) and CCL2 gene expression was also 
      assessed in laser-captured alveolar septae from patients with IPF. The ability of 
      PAR(1) to induce CCL2 production by lung epithelial cells was also examined in 
      vitro. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We report for the first time that PAR(1) 
      and CCL2 are coexpressed and co-up-regulated on the activated epithelium in 
      fibrotic areas in IPF. Similar observations were found in bleomycin-induced lung 
      injury. Furthermore, we show that thrombin is a potent inducer of CCL2 gene 
      expression and protein release by cultured lung epithelial cells via a 
      PAR(1)-dependent mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the notion that 
      PAR(1) activation on lung epithelial cells may represent an important mechanism 
      leading to increased local CCL2 release in pulmonary fibrosis. Targeting PAR(1) 
      on the pulmonary epithelium may offer a unique opportunity for therapeutic 
      intervention in pulmonary fibrosis and other inflammatory and fibroproliferative 
      conditions associated with excessive local generation of thrombin and CCL2 
      release.

TI  - Role for alpha3 integrin in EMT and pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 7-10
LID - 10.1172/JCI38084 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by progressive 
      (myo)fibroblast accumulation and collagen deposition. One possible source of 
      (myo)fibroblasts is epithelial cells that undergo epithelial-mesenchymal 
      transition (EMT), a process frequently mediated by TGF-beta. In this issue of the 
      JCI, Kim et al. report that epithelial cell-specific deletion of alpha3 integrin 
      prevents EMT in mice, thereby protecting against bleomycin-induced fibrosis (see 
      the related article beginning on page 213). The authors propose a novel mechanism 
      linking TGF-beta and beta-catenin signaling in EMT through integrin-dependent 
      association of tyrosine-phosphorylated beta-catenin and pSmad2 and suggest 
      targeted disruption of this interaction as a potential therapeutic approach.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a refractory and lethal interstitial lung 
      disease characterized by alveolar epithelial cells apoptosis, fibroblast 
      proliferation and extra-cellular matrix protein deposition. EBV, localised to 
      alveolar epithelial cells of pulmonary fibrosis patients is associated with a 
      poor prognosis. A strategy based on microarray-differential gene expression 
      analysis to identify molecular drivers of EBV-associated lung fibrosis was 
      utilized. Alveolar epithelial cells were infected with EBV to identify genes 
      whose expression was altered following TGFbeta1-mediated lytic phase. EBV lytic 
      reactivation by TGFbeta1 drives a selective alteration in CUX1 variant (a) (NCBI 
      accession number NM_181552) expression, inducing activation of non-canonical Wnt 
      pathway mediators, implicating it in Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), the 
      molecular event underpinning scar production in tissue fibrosis. The role of EBV 
      in EMT can be attenuated by antiviral strategies and inhibition of Wnt signaling 
      by using All-Trans Retinoic Acids (ATRA). Activation of non-canonical Wnt 
      signaling pathway by EBV in epithelial cells suggests a novel mechanism of EMT 
      via CUX1 signaling. These data present a framework for further description of the 
      link between infectious agents and fibrosis, a significant disease burden.

AB  - RATIONALE: The molecular mechanisms underlying acute exacerbations of idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are poorly understood. We studied the global gene 
      expression signature of acute exacerbations of IPF. OBJECTIVES: To understand the 
      gene expression patterns of acute exacerbations of IPF. METHODS: RNA was 
      extracted from 23 stable IPF lungs, 8 IPF lungs with acute exacerbation 
      (IPF-AEx), and 15 control lungs and used for hybridization on Agilent gene 
      expression microarrays. Functional analysis of genes was performed with Spotfire 
      and Genomica. Gene validations for MMP1, MMP7, AGER, DEFA1-3, COL1A2, and CCNA2 
      were performed by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain 
      reaction. Immunohistochemistry and in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase 
      dUTP nick end-labeling assays were performed on the same tissues used for the 
      microarray. ELISA for alpha-defensins was performed on plasma from control 
      subjects, patients with stable IPF, and patients with IPF-AEx. MEASUREMENTS AND 
      MAIN RESULTS: Gene expression patterns in IPF-AEx and IPF samples were similar 
      for the genes that distinguish IPF from control lungs. Five hundred and 
      seventy-nine genes were differentially expressed (false discovery rate < 5%) 
      between stable IPF and IPF-AEx. Functional analysis of these genes did not 
      indicate any evidence of an infectious or overwhelming inflammatory etiology. 
      CCNA2 and alpha-defensins were among the most up-regulated genes. CCNA2 and 
      alpha-defensin protein levels were also higher and localized to the epithelium of 
      IPF-AEx, where widespread apoptosis was also detected. alpha-Defensin protein 
      levels were increased in the peripheral blood of patients with IPF-AEx. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that IPF-AEx is characterized by enhanced 
      epithelial injury and proliferation, as reflected by increases in CCNA2 and 
      alpha-defensins and apoptosis of epithelium. The concomitant increase in 
      alpha-defensins in the peripheral blood and lungs may suggest their use as 
      biomarkers for this disorder.

      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 140-8
LID - 10.1165/rcmb.2008-0419OC [doi]
AB  - Increased apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells and impaired apoptosis of 
      myofibroblasts have been linked to the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis/usual interstitial pneumonia (IPF/UIP). Fas, a death receptor of the 
      TNF-receptor superfamily, has been implicated in apoptosis of both cell types, 
      though the mechanisms are poorly understood. The goals of this study were: (1) to 
      examine the localization of Fas-associated death-domain-like IL-1beta-converting 
      enzyme inhibitory protein (c-FLIP), an NF-kappaB-dependent regulator of 
      Fas-signaling, in lung tissues from IPF/UIP patients and control subjects; and 
      (2) to compare c-FLIP expression with epithelial cell and myofibroblast 
      apoptosis, proliferation, and NF-kappaB activation. c-FLIP expression was 
      restricted to airway epithelial cells in control lung tissues. In contrast, in 
      patients with IPF/UIP, c-FLIP was also expressed by alveolar epithelial cells in 
      areas of injury and fibrosis, but was absent from myofibroblasts in fibroblastic 
      foci and from alveolar epithelial cells in uninvolved areas of lung tissue. 
      Quantification of apoptosis and proliferation revealed an absence of apoptotic or 
      proliferating cells in fibroblastic foci and low levels of apoptosis and 
      proliferation by alveolar epithelial cells. Quantification of NF-kappaB 
      expression and nuclear translocation revealed strong staining and translocation 
      in alveolar epithelial cells and weak staining and minimal nuclear translocation 
      in myofibroblasts. These findings suggest that: (1) c-FLIP expression is induced 
      in the abnormal alveolar epithelium of patients with IPF/UIP, (2) the resistance 
      of myofibroblasts to apoptosis in patients with IPF/UIP occurs independently of 
      c-FLIP expression, and (3) increased NF-kappaB activation and c-FLIP expression 
      by the alveolar epithelium may be linked.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) can lead to the development of secondary 
      pulmonary hypertension (PH) and ultimately death. Despite this known association, 
      the precise mechanism of disease remains unknown. Using a rat model of IPF, we 
      explored the role of the proangiogenic and antiapoptotic growth factor VEGF in 
      the vascular remodeling that underlies PH. In this model, adenoviral delivery of 
      active TGF-beta1 induces pulmonary arterial remodeling, loss of the 
      microvasculature in fibrotic areas, and increased pulmonary arterial pressure 
      (PAP). Immunohistochemistry and mRNA analysis revealed decreased levels of VEGF 
      and its receptor, which were inversely correlated with PAP and endothelial cell 
      apoptosis in both the micro- and macrovasculature. Treatment of IPF rats with 
      adenoviral delivery of VEGF resulted in reduced endothelial apoptosis, increased 
      vascularization, and improved PAP due to reduced remodeling but worsened PF. 
      These data show that experimental pulmonary fibrosis (PF) leads to loss of the 
      microvasculature through increased apoptosis and to remodeling of the pulmonary 
      arteries, with both processes resulting in PH. As administration of VEGF 
      ameliorated the PH in this model but concomitantly aggravated the fibrogenic 
      process, VEGF-based therapies should be used with caution.

      cyclooxygenase 2 in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - Diminished cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) expression in fibroblasts, with a resultant 
      defect in the production of the antifibrotic mediator prostaglandin E(2), plays a 
      key role in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Here, we 
      have characterized the molecular mechanism. We found that COX-2 mRNA levels in 
      fibroblasts from patients with IPF (F-IPF) were significantly lower than those in 
      fibroblasts from nonfibrotic lungs (F-NL) after transforming growth factor beta1 
      and interleukin-1beta treatment but that COX-2 mRNA degradation rates were 
      similar, suggesting defective transcription. A reporter gene assay showed that 
      there were no clear differences between F-IPF and F-NL in transcription factor 
      involvement and activation in COX-2 gene transcription. However, a chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation assay revealed that transcription factor binding to the COX-2 
      promoter in F-IPF was reduced compared to that in F-NL, an effect that was 
      dynamically linked to reduced histone H3 and H4 acetylation due to decreased 
      recruitment of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and increased recruitment of 
      transcriptional corepressor complexes to the COX-2 promoter. The treatment of 
      F-IPF with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors together with cytokines 
      increased histone H3 and H4 acetylation. Both HDAC inhibitors and the 
      overexpression of HATs restored cytokine-induced COX-2 mRNA and protein 
      expression in F-IPF. The results demonstrate that epigenetic abnormality in the 
      form of histone hypoacetylation is responsible for diminished COX-2 expression in 
      IPF.

TI  - Genetic and environmental factors influencing human diseases with telomere 
      dysfunction.
PG  - 114-30
AB  - Both genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in the mechanism 
      underlying the pathogenesis of serious and fatal forms of human blood disorder 
      (acquired aplastic anemia, AA) and lung disease (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, 
      IPF). We and other researchers have recently shown that naturally occurring 
      mutations in genes encoding the telomere maintenance complex (telomerase) may 
      predispose patients to the development of AA or IPF. Epidemiological data have 
      shown that environmental factors can also cause and/or exacerbate the 
      pathogenesis of these diseases. The exact mechanisms that these germ-line 
      mutations in telomere maintenance genes coupled with environmental insults lead 
      to ineffective hematopoiesis in AA and lung scarring in IPF are not well 
      understood, however. In this article, we provide a summary of evidence for 
      environmental and genetic factors influencing the diseases. These studies provide 
      important insights into the interplay between environmental and genetic factors 
      leading to human diseases with telomere dysfunction.

AB  - IPF is a devastating disease with few therapeutic options. The precise aetiology 
      of IPF remains elusive. However, our understanding of the pathologic processes 
      involved in the initiation and progression of this disease is improving. Data on 
      the mechanisms underlying IPF have been generated from epidemiologic 
      investigations as well as cellular and molecular studies of human tissues. 
      Although no perfect animal model of human IPF exists, pre-clinical animal studies 
      have helped define pathways which are likely important in human disease. 
      Epithelial injury, fibroblast activation and repetitive cycles of injury and 
      abnormal repair are almost certainly key events. Factors which have been 
      associated with initiation and/or progression of IPF include viral infections, 
      abnormal cytokine, chemokine and growth factor production, oxidant stress, 
      autoimmunity, inhalational of toxicants and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. 
      Furthermore, recent evidence identifies a role for a variety of genetic and 
      epigenetic abnormalities ranging from mutations in surfactant protein C to 
      abnormalities in telomere length and telomerase activity. The challenge remains 
      to identify additional inciting agents and key dysregulated pathways that lead to 
      disease progression so that we can develop targeted therapies to treat or prevent 
      this serious disease.

TI  - SNAI transcription factors mediate epithelial-mesenchymal transition in lung 
      fibrosis.
PG  - 1053-61
LID - 10.1136/thx.2009.121798 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal interstitial lung 
      disease characterised by accumulation of activated (myo)fibroblasts and excessive 
      extracellular matrix deposition. The enhanced accumulation of (myo)fibroblasts 
      may be attributed, in part, to the process of transforming growth factor beta1 
      (TGFbeta1)-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), the phenotypic 
      switching of epithelial to fibroblast-like cells. Although alveolar epithelial 
      type II (ATII) cells have been shown to undergo EMT, the precise mediators and 
      mechanisms remain to be resolved. The objective of this study is to investigate 
      the role of SNAI transcription factors in the process of EMT and in IPF. METHODS: 
      Using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), immunofluorescence, 
      immunohistochemistry, western blotting, as well as gain- and loss-of-function 
      studies and functional assays, the role of SNAI1 and SNAI2 in TGFbeta1-induced 
      EMT in ATII cells in vitro was assessed; and the expression of SNAI transcription 
      factors was analysed in experimental and human IPF in vivo. RESULTS: TGFbeta1 
      treatment increased the expression and nuclear accumulation of SNAI1 and SNAI2, 
      in concert with induction of EMT in ATII cells. SNAI overexpression was 
      sufficient to induce EMT, and small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated SNAI 
      depletion attenuated TGFbeta1-induced ATII cell migration and EMT. SNAI 
      expression was elevated in experimental and human IPF and localised to 
      hyperplastic ATII cells in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that 
      TGFbeta1-induced EMT in ATII cells is essentially controlled by the expression 
      and nuclear translocation of SNAI transcription factors. Increased SNAI1 and 
      SNAI2 expression in experimental and human IPF in vivo suggests that 
      SNAI-mediated EMT may contribute to the fibroblast pool in idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive lung disease of 
      unknown etiology. We previously revealed increased oxidative stress and high 
      expression of antioxidant proteins in culture cell lines established from 
      lesional lung tissues with IPF (Kabuyama Y, Oshima K, Kitamura T, Homma M, Yamaki 
      J, Munakata M, Homma Y. Genes Cells 12: 1235-1244, 2007). In this study, we show 
      that IPF cells contain high levels of free cholesterol and its peroxidized form 
      as compared with normal TIG7 lung fibroblasts, suggesting that radical oxygen 
      species (ROS) are generated within specific organelles. To understand the 
      molecular basis underlying the generation of ROS in IPF cells, we performed 
      proteomic analysis of mitochondrial proteins from TIG and IPF cells. This 
      analysis shows that the phosphorylation of Ser586 of very long chain acyl-CoA 
      dehydrogenase (VLCAD) is significantly reduced in IPF cells. Similar results are 
      obtained from immunoblotting with anti-pS586 antibody. Kinase activity toward a 
      peptide containing Ser586 from IPF cells is significantly lower than that from 
      TIG cells. Furthermore, a phosphorylation-negative mutant (S586A) VLCAD shows 
      reduced electron transfer activity and a strong dominant-negative effect on fatty 
      acid beta-oxidation. The ectopic expression of the S586A mutant induced human 
      embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells to produce significantly high amounts of 
      oxidized lipids and hydrogen peroxide. HEK293 cells expressing the S586A mutant 
      exhibit a reduction in cell growth and an enhancement in apoptosis. These results 
      suggest a novel regulatory mechanism for homeostatic VLCAD activity, whose 
      dysregulation might be involved in the production of oxidative stress and in the 
      pathogenesis of IPF.

TI  - Prostaglandin F(2alpha) receptor signaling facilitates bleomycin-induced 
      pulmonary fibrosis independently of transforming growth factor-beta.
PG  - 1426-30
LID - 10.1038/nm.2066 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease characterized by 
      fibroblast proliferation and excess deposition of collagen and other 
      extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, which lead to distorted lung architecture 
      and function. Given that anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive therapy currently 
      used for IPF does not improve disease progression therapies targeted to blocking 
      the mechanisms of fibrogenesis are needed. Although transforming growth 
      factor-beta (TGF-beta) functions are crucial in fibrosis, antagonizing this 
      pathway in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, an animal model of IPF, does not 
      prevent fibrosis completely, indicating an additional pathway also has a key role 
      in fibrogenesis. Given that the loss of cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)) 
      suppresses bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, we examined the roles of 
      prostaglandins using mice lacking each prostoaglandin receptor. Here we show that 
      loss of prostaglandin F (PGF) receptor (FP) selectively attenuates pulmonary 
      fibrosis while maintaining similar levels of alveolar inflammation and TGF-beta 
      stimulation as compared to wild-type (WT) mice, and that FP deficiency and 
      inhibition of TGF-beta signaling additively decrease fibrosis. Furthermore, 
      PGF(2alpha) is abundant in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of subjects with 
      IPF and stimulates proliferation and collagen production of lung fibroblasts via 
      FP, independently of TGF-beta. These findings show that PGF(2alpha)-FP signaling 
      facilitates pulmonary fibrosis independently of TGF-beta and suggests this 
      signaling pathway as a therapeutic target for IPF.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is associated with aberrant repair, 
      persistence of collagen deposition, and the development of vascular remodeling. 
      However, the role of angiogenesis in the pathogenesis of IPF is still 
      undetermined. The aim of this study was to evaluate the combined mRNA expression 
      of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), fibroblast growth factor 2 
      (FGF2), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) epidermal growth factor (EGF), and 
      its receptor (EGFR) in lung tissue obtained from IPF patients. We have also 
      investigated the expression of chemokine CXCL12/stromal cell-derived factor-1 
      (SDF-1) and its receptor, CXCR4, to identify alterations that maybe implicated in 
      the pathogenesis of IPF. The subjects studied consisted of two distinct groups: 
      patients with IPF (n = 25) and subjects (control) undergoing thoracic surgery for 
      reasons other than interstitial lung disease (n = 10). Expression analysis of the 
      aforementioned growth factors and biological axis CXCL12/CXR4 analysis were 
      performed using real-time RT-PCR. IGF-1, EGF, and FGF2 mRNA levels are 
      significantly decreased in the patients compared to the controls (p = 0.028, p = 
      0.023 and p = 0.009, respectively). SDF1-TR1 and SDF1-TR2 transcript levels were 
      significantly lower in patients compared to controls (p = 0.017 and p = 0.001). 
      Significant coexpression of VEGF mRNA with IGF mRNA was observed in the group of 
      the patients (p = 0.017). An additional coexpression of VEGF mRNA with SDF1-TR1 
      mRNA was demonstrated(p = 0.030). Our results show a downregulation in 
      angiogenetic mechanisms in IPF. However, our results should be further verified 
      by measuring other angiogenetic pathways in more samples.

TI  - Genomewide RNA expression profiling in lung identifies distinct signatures in 
      idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension and secondary pulmonary hypertension.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a life-threatening condition 
      characterized by pulmonary arteriolar remodeling. This investigation aimed to 
      identify genes involved specifically in the pathogenesis of PAH and not other 
      forms of pulmonary hypertension (PH). Using genomewide microarray analysis, we 
      generated the largest data set to date of RNA expression profiles from lung 
      tissue specimens from 1) 18 PAH subjects and 2) 8 subjects with PH secondary to 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and 3) 13 normal subjects. A molecular 
      signature of 4,734 genes discriminated among these three cohorts. We identified 
      significant novel biological changes that were likely to contribute to the 
      pathogenesis of PAH, including regulation of actin-based motility, protein 
      ubiquitination, and cAMP, transforming growth factor-beta, MAPK, estrogen 
      receptor, nitric oxide, and PDGF signaling. Bone morphogenic protein receptor 
      type II expression was downregulated, even in subjects without a mutation in this 
      gene. Women with PAH had higher expression levels of estrogen receptor 1 than 
      normal women. Real-time quantitative PCR confirmed differential expression of the 
      following genes in PAH relative to both normal controls and PH secondary to IPF: 
      a disintegrin-like and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 motif 9, cell 
      adhesion molecule with homology to L1CAM, cytochrome b(558) and beta-polypeptide, 
      coagulation factor II receptor-like 3, A-myb myeloblastosis viral oncogene 
      homolog 1, nuclear receptor coactivator 2, purinergic receptor P2Y, platelet 
      factor 4, phospholamban, and tropomodulin 3. This study shows that PAH and PH 
      secondary to IPF are characterized by distinct gene expression signatures, 
      implying distinct pathophysiological mechanisms.

AB  - Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) include more than 200 disease entities such as 
      drug induced ILD, radiation pneumonitis, collagen vascular disease-associated 
      interstitial pneumonia, and idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs). Idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) represents the most common IIP, and is one of the most 
      aggressive interstitial lung diseases. ILDs, especially in IPF, are associated 
      with an independent increased risk of lung cancer. Repetitive stimulation, 
      alveolar epithelial injury and dysregulated repair induced by IPF cause genetic 
      errors, which in turn may predispose to the development of lung cancer. We 
      previously established a mouse IgG1 mAb that recognizes a sialylated sugar chain 
      on lung adenocarcinoma cells, designated KL-6. KL-6 is a high-molecular-weight 
      glycoprotein classified as Cluster 9 (MUC1) lung tumor and differentiation 
      antigens. KL-6 has been reported to serve as a sensitive serum marker for 
      interstitial pneumonia and is now clinically used to detect the presence of 
      interstitial pneumonia in Japan; however, recent studies have suggested that it 
      can also be used as a tumor marker as its origin shows. We also found that there 
      is a natural auto-antibody against KL-6 at high levels in sera from healthy 
      volunteers and at low levels in sera from patients with non-small cell lung 
      cancer. The concentration strongly correlated with their good prognoses. 
      Furthermore, we demonstrated that anti-KL-6 mAb induced capping of MUC1 of breast 
      cancer cell lines, which proliferate in suspension culture without aggregation. 
      Moreover, anti-KL-6 mAb enhanced the cytotoxic activity of lymphokine-activated 
      killer cells. The pathogenesis of lung cancer in ILDs is unclear, but some 
      genetic factors seem to be involved. Further studies are needed to clarify the 
      causes and the mechanisms that link ILDs and lung cancer.

AB  - Recent years have seen a robust influx of exciting new observations regarding the 
      mechanisms that regulate the initiation and progression of pulmonary fibrosis but 
      the pathogenesis remains poorly understood. The search for an alternative 
      hypothesis to unremitting, chronic inflammation as the primary explanation for 
      the pathophysiology of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) derives, in part, from 
      the lack of therapeutic efficacy of high-dose immunosuppressive therapy in 
      patients with IPF. The inflammatory hypothesis of IPF has since been challenged 
      by the epithelial injury hypothesis, in which fibrosis is believed to result from 
      epithelial injury, activation, and/or apoptosis with abnormal wound healing. This 
      hypothesis suggests that recurrent unknown injury to distal pulmonary parenchyma 
      causes repeated epithelial injury and apoptosis. The resultant loss of alveolar 
      epithelium exposes the underlying basement membrane to oxidative damage and 
      degradation. Emerging concepts suggest that IPF is the result of 
      epithelial-mesenchymal interaction. The initiation of this fibrotic response may 
      depend upon genetic factors and environmental triggers; the role of Th1 or Th2 
      cell-derived cytokines may also be important. This process appears to be unique 
      to usual interstitial pneumonia/IPF. It is clear that IPF is a heterogeneous 
      disease with variations in pathology, high-resolution computed tomography 
      findings, and patterns of progression. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a complex 
      disorder, and no unifying hypothesis has been identified at present that explains 
      all the abnormalities.

AB  - Several clinical trials have recently targeted specific pathways implicated in 
      the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, IPF remains 
      plagued by a median survival of 3 yrs and emphasises the need for further 
      research with new insights and perspectives. The prevailing pathogenic hypotheses 
      assume that either an inflammatory process or an independent 
      epithelial/fibroblastic disorder may propagate the disease process. Based on 
      knowledge developed with considerable scientific evidence, we provide our 
      perspectives with an alternative point of view that IPF be considered as a 
      neoproliferative disorder of the lung. Genetic alterations, response to growth 
      and inhibitory signals, resistance to apoptosis, myofibroblast origin and 
      behaviour, altered cellular communications, and intracellular signalling pathways 
      are all fundamental pathogenic hallmarks of both IPF and cancer. The concept of 
      IPF as a lethal malignant disorder of the lung might extend beyond the pathogenic 
      link between these two diseases and disclose new pathogenic mechanisms leading to 
      novel therapeutic options, adopted from cancer biology. Moreover, this vision 
      might dawn the awareness of the public, political and scientific community of 
      this devastating disease from an angle different from the current perception and 
      provoke new ideas and studies to get a better understanding to control the 
      otherwise relentless progressive disease.

TI  - Pathologic caveolin-1 regulation of PTEN in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 2626-37
LID - 10.2353/ajpath.2010.091117 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fibroproliferative disorder 
      refractory to current pharmacological therapies. Fibroblasts isolated from IPF 
      patients display pathological activation of PI3K/Akt caused by low PTEN 
      phosphatase activity. This enables these cells to escape the negative 
      proliferative properties of polymerized collagen. The mechanism underlying low 
      PTEN activity in IPF fibroblasts is unclear, but our prior studies indicate that 
      membrane-associated PTEN expression is decreased in these cells. Caveolin-1 is an 
      integral membrane protein whose expression is decreased in IPF lung tissue, but 
      how low caveolin-1 contributes to pathological fibrosis is incompletely 
      understood. The objective of this study was to examine the hypothesis that 
      caveolin-1 regulates PTEN function in IPF fibroblasts. Here we demonstrate that 
      caveolin-1 expression is a determinant of membrane PTEN levels and show that PTEN 
      interacts with caveolin-1 via its caveolin-1-binding sequence. We demonstrate 
      that caveolin-1 expression is low in IPF fibroblasts and that this correlates 
      with low membrane PTEN levels, whereas overexpression of caveolin-1 restores 
      membrane PTEN levels, inhibits Akt phosphorylation, and suppresses proliferation. 
      We demonstrate that caveolin-1 and PTEN expression are low in myofibroblasts 
      within IPF fibroblastic foci. These data indicate that IPF fibroblasts display 
      low caveolin-1 expression, which results in low membrane-associated PTEN 
      expression. This creates a membrane microenvironment depleted of inhibitory

TI  - Repression of IP-10 by interactions between histone deacetylation and 
      hypermethylation in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 2874-86
LID - 10.1128/MCB.01527-09 [doi]
AB  - Targeted repression of a subset of key genes involved in tissue remodeling is a 
      cardinal feature of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The mechanism is unclear 
      but is potentially important in disease pathogenesis and therapeutic targeting. 
      We have previously reported that defective histone acetylation is responsible for 
      the repression of the antifibrotic cyclooxygenase-2 gene. Here we extended our 
      study to the repression of another antifibrotic gene, the potent angiostatic 
      chemokine gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-inducible protein of 10 kDa (IP-10), in 
      lung fibroblasts from patients with IPF. We revealed that this involved not only 
      histone deacetylation, as with cyclooxygenase-2 repression, but also histone H3 
      hypermethylation, as a result of decreased recruitment of histone 
      acetyltransferases and increased presence of histone deacetylase 
      (HDAC)-containing repressor complexes, histone methyltransferases G9a and 
      SUV39H1, and heterochromatin protein 1 at the IP-10 promoter, leading to reduced 
      transcription factor binding. More importantly, treatment of diseased cells with 
      HDAC or G9a inhibitors similarly reversed the repressive histone deacetylation 
      and hypermethylation and restored IP-10 expression. These findings strongly 
      suggest that epigenetic dysregulation involving interactions between histone 
      deacetylation and hypermethylation is responsible for targeted repression of 
      IP-10 and potentially other antifibrotic genes in fibrotic lung disease and that 
      this is amenable to therapeutic targeting.

TI  - Tectorigenin inhibits the in vitro proliferation and enhances miR-338* expression 
      of pulmonary fibroblasts in rats with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 165-73
LID - 10.1016/j.jep.2010.06.022 [doi]
AB  - Tectorigenin is one of the main components in rhizomes of Iris tectorum, which is 
      traditionally used to treat disorders such as hepatic cirrhosis caused by 
      fibrosis. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), one of the most common 
      interstitial lung diseases, is caused by accumulation of fibroblasts in lungs. 
      AIM OF THE STUDY: In this work we sought to examine the effects of tectorigenin 
      on pulmonary fibroblasts in the IPF animal model and investigated the molecular 
      mechanism (microRNA regulation) of tectorigenin treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      A well-known animal disease model of pulmonary fibrosis in rat was established by 
      intratracheally instilling of bleomycin. In vitro cultured pulmonary fibroblasts 
      in bleomycin-treated rats and in controls were treated with or without 
      tectorigenin. Comparative analyses of cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell 
      cycle of pulmonary fibroblasts in bleomycin-treated rats and in controls were 
      performed. Expression of miR-338* and its candidate gene LPA1 related to IPF of 
      tectorigenin-treated pulmonary fibroblasts in bleomycin-treated rats were further 
      investigated. RESULTS: Tectorigenin significantly inhibited the proliferation of 
      pulmonary fibroblasts in bleomycin-treated rats but not in controls. However, no 
      altered cell cycle and apoptosis of pulmonary fibroblasts in bleomycin-treated 
      rats and in controls was observed after tectorigenin treatment. Tectorigenin 
      remarkably enhanced miR-338* expression of pulmonary fibroblasts in 
      bleomycin-treated rats and downregulated LPA1 in the protein level. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Tectorigenin inhibits the proliferation of pulmonary fibroblasts in vitro and 
      enhances miR-338* expression, which might in turn downregulate LPA1. This 
      indicates a potential inhibitory role of tectorigenin on the pathogenesis of IPF.

TI  - miR-21 mediates fibrogenic activation of pulmonary fibroblasts and lung fibrosis.
PG  - 1589-97
LID - 10.1084/jem.20100035 [doi]
AB  - Uncontrolled extracellular matrix production by fibroblasts in response to tissue 
      injury contributes to fibrotic diseases, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
      (IPF), a progressive and ultimately fatal process that currently has no cure. 
      Although dysregulation of miRNAs is known to be involved in a variety of 
      pathophysiologic processes, the role of miRNAs in fibrotic lung diseases is 
      unclear. In this study, we found up-regulation of miR-21 in the lungs of mice 
      with bleomycin-induced fibrosis and also in the lungs of patients with IPF. 
      Increased miR-21 expression was primarily localized to myofibroblasts. 
      Administration of miR-21 antisense probes diminished the severity of experimental 
      lung fibrosis in mice, even when treatment was started 5-7 d after initiation of 
      pulmonary injury. TGF-beta1, a central pathological mediator of fibrotic 
      diseases, enhanced miR-21 expression in primary pulmonary fibroblasts. Increasing 
      miR-21 levels promoted, whereas knocking down miR-21 attenuated, the 
      pro-fibrogenic activity of TGF-beta1 in fibroblasts. A potential mechanism for 
      the role of miR-21 in fibrosis is through regulating the expression of an 
      inhibitory Smad, Smad7. These experiments demonstrate an important role for 
      miR-21 in fibrotic lung diseases and also suggest a novel approach using miRNA 
      therapeutics in treating clinically refractory fibrotic diseases, such as IPF.

PG  - 2769-76
AB  - Pulmonary fibrosis complicates a number of disease processes and leads to 
      substantial morbidity and mortality. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is 
      perhaps the most pernicious and enigmatic form of the greater problem of lung 
      fibrogenesis with a median survival of three years from diagnosis in affected 
      patients. In this review, we will focus on the pathology of IPF as a model of 
      pulmonary fibrotic processes, review possible cellular mechanisms, review current 
      treatment approaches and review two transgenic mouse models of lung fibrosis to 
      provide insight into processes that cause lung fibrosis. We will also summarize 
      the potential utility of signaling pathway inhibitors as a future treatment in 
      pulmonary fibrosis. Finally, we will present data demonstrating a minimal 
      contribution of epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the development of fibrotic 
      lesions in the transforming growth factor-alpha transgenic model of lung 
      fibrosis.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an interstitial lung disease (ILD) 
      affecting the pulmonary interstitium. Other forms of interstitial lung disease 
      exist, and in some cases, an environmental etiology can be delineated. The 
      diagnosis of IPF is typically established by high-resolution CT scan. IPF tends 
      to have a worse prognosis than other forms of ILD. Familial cases of IPF also 
      exist, suggesting a genetic predisposition; telomerase mutations have been 
      observed to occur in familial IPF, which may also explain the increase in IPF 
      with advancing age. Alveolar epithelial cells are believed to be the primary 
      target of environmental agents that have been putatively associated with IPF. 
      These agents may include toxins, viruses, or the autoantibodies found in collagen 
      vascular diseases. The mechanism of disease is still unclear in IPF, but 
      aberrations in fibroblast differentiation, activation, and proliferation may play 
      a role. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition may also be an important factor in the 
      pathogenesis, as it may lead to accumulation of fibroblasts in the lung and a 
      disruption of normal tissue structure. Abnormalities in other components of the 
      immune system, including T cells, B cells, and dendritic cells, as well as the 
      development of ectopic lymphoid tissue, have also been observed to occur in IPF 
      and may play a role in the stimulation of fibrosis that is a hallmark of the 
      disease. It is becoming increasingly clear that the pathogenesis of IPF is indeed 
      a complex and convoluted process that involves numerous cell types and humoral 
      factors.

TI  - Hypermethylation of PTGER2 confers prostaglandin E2 resistance in fibrotic 
      fibroblasts from humans and mice.
PG  - 2245-55

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating lung disease that is 
      characterized by excessive proliferation of fibroblasts. The lipid mediator 
      prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) has the capacity to limit fibrosis through its inhibition 
      of numerous functions of these fibroblasts; however, in the setting of fibrosis, 
      fibroblasts have been shown to be resistant to PGE2. We have linked such 
      resistance to decreased expression levels of the E prostanoid 2 (EP2) receptor. 
      In this study, in fibroblasts from both mice and humans with pulmonary fibrosis, 
      we show that DNA hypermethylation is responsible for diminished EP2 expression 
      levels and PGE2 resistance. Bisulfite sequencing of the prostaglandin E receptor 
      2 gene (PTGER2) promoter revealed that fibrotic fibroblasts exhibit greater 
      PTGER2 methylation than nonfibrotic control cells. Treatment with the DNA 
      methylation inhibitors 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and zebularine as well as DNA 
      methyltransferase-specific siRNA decreased PTGER2 methylation, increased EP2 mRNA 
      and protein expression levels, and restored PGE2 responsiveness in fibrotic 
      fibroblasts but not in nonfibrotic controls. PTGER2 promoter hypermethylation was 
      driven by an increase in Akt signal transduction. In addition to results 
      described for the PTGER2 promoter, fibrotic fibroblasts also exhibited increased 
      global DNA methylation. These findings demonstrate that the down-regulation of 
      PTGER2 and consequent PGE2 resistance are both mediated by DNA hypermethylation; 
      we identified increased Akt signal transduction as a novel mechanism that 
      promotes DNA hypermethylation during fibrogenesis.

TI  - Fcgamma receptor IIIb (CD16b) polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 475-81
LID - 10.1007/s00408-010-9262-3 [doi]
AB  - An excess of neutrophils in the alveoli and lung interstitium has been described 
      in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Engagement of neutrophil Fcgamma receptors 
      with IgG complexes may contribute to the pathogenesis of IPF. The neutrophil 
      FcgammaRIIIb receptor occurs in two codominantly expressed allelic variants, NA1 and 
      NA2, which exhibit different binding affinities for IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses. The 
      aim of this study was to investigate whether FcgammaRIIIb genotype is associated with 
      IPF susceptibility or disease progression. In a case-control study we compared 
      the distribution of FcgammaRIIIb NA1/2 polymorphisms in 142 patients with IPF and in 
      218 controls using allele-specific PCR amplification. Significant skewing in the 
      distribution of FcgammaRIIIb genotypes was observed between patients with IPF and 
      control subjects. In the IPF cohort, there was higher frequency of the NA1/NA1 
      genotype (0.19 vs. 0.07), and lower NA2/NA2 frequency (0.31 vs. 0.50; chi(2) = 
      17.71, df = 2, P < 0.001). The overall frequency of the NA1 allele was increased 
      in IPF patients compared to controls (0.44 vs. 0.29; P < 0.0001, odds ratio [OR] 
      = 1.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.42-2.64). Heterozygotes and homozygotes 
      of the NA1 allele were at higher risk of developing IPF (OR = 2.19, 95% CI = 
      1.40-3.41, P = 0.0005), whereas the NA2 allele was protective against IPF (OR = 
      0.34, 95% CI = 0.17-0.65, P = 0.0014). There was no association of FcgammaRIIIb 
      genotype with disease progression as assessed by serial lung function 
      measurements. FcgammaRIIIb NA1/2 polymorphisms are associated with IPF disease 
      susceptibility. These results support a role for immunological mechanisms 
      contributing to IPF pathogenesis.

TI  - Association of FcgammaRIIa R131H polymorphism with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
      severity and progression.
PG  - 51
LID - 10.1186/1471-2466-10-51 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A significant genetic component has been described for idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The R131H (rs1801274) polymorphism of the IgG receptor 
      FcgammaRIIa determines receptor affinity for IgG subclasses and is associated with 
      several chronic inflammatory diseases. We investigated whether this polymorphism 
      is associated with IPF susceptibility or progression. METHODS: In a case-control 
      study, we compared the distribution of FcgammaRIIa R131H genotypes in 142 patients 
      with IPF and in 218 controls using allele-specific PCR amplification. RESULTS: No 
      differences in the frequency of FcgammaRIIa genotypes were evident between IPF 
      patients and control subjects. However, significantly impaired pulmonary function 
      at diagnosis was observed in HH compared to RR homozygotes, with evidence of more 
      severe restriction (reduced forced vital capacity (FVC)) and lower diffusing 
      capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO). Similarly, increased frequency of the H131 
      allele was observed in patients with severe disease (DLCO < 40% predicted) (0.53 
      vs. 0.38; p = 0.03). Furthermore, the H131 allele was associated with progressive 
      pulmonary fibrosis as determined by > 10% drop in FVC and/or > 15% fall in DLCO 
      at 12 months after baseline (0.48 vs. 0.33; p = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS: These 
      findings support an association between the FcgammaRIIa R131H polymorphism and IPF 
      severity and progression, supporting the involvement of immunological mechanisms 
      in IPF pathogenesis.

PG  - 154-62
LID - 10.1016/j.biocel.2010.10.013 [doi]
AB  - The pleiotropic growth factor TGFbeta(1) promotes many of the pathogenic mechanisms 
      observed in lung fibrosis and airway remodeling, such as aberrant extracellular 
      matrix deposition due to both fibroblast activation and fibroblast to 
      myofibroblast differentiation. Serum amyloid P (SAP), a member of the pentraxin 
      family of proteins inhibits bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis through an inhibition 
      of pulmonary fibrocyte and pro-fibrotic alternative (M2) macrophage accumulation. 
      It is unknown if SAP has effects downstream of TGFbeta(1), a major mediator of 
      pulmonary fibrosis. Using the lung specific TGFbeta(1) transgenic mouse model, we 
      determined that SAP inhibits all of the pathologies driven by TGFbeta(1) including 
      apoptosis, airway inflammation, pulmonary fibrocyte accumulation and collagen 
      deposition, without affecting levels of TGFbeta(1). To explore the role of monocyte 
      derived cells in this model we used liposomal clodronate to deplete pulmonary 
      macrophages. This led to pronounced anti-fibrotic effects that were independent 
      of fibrocyte accumulation. Administration of SAP mirrored these effects and 
      reduced both pulmonary M2 macrophages and increased chemokine IP10/CXCL10 
      expression in a SMAD 3-independent manner. Interestingly, SAP concentrations were 
      reduced in the circulation of IPF patients and correlated with disease severity. 
      Last, SAP directly inhibited M2 macrophage differentiation of monocytes obtained 
      from these patients. These data suggest that the beneficial anti-fibrotic effects 
      of SAP in TGFbeta(1)-induced lung disease are via modulating monocyte responses.

TI  - Epithelial stem cell exhaustion in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis.
PG  - 7-18
AB  - New paradigms have been recently proposed in the pathogenesis of idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), evidencing that in IPF the cumulative action of an 
      accelerated parenchymal senescence determined by either telomere dysfunction or 
      genetic defects, together with the concurrent noxious activity of tobacco 
      smoking, are able to severely compromise the regenerative potential of 
      parenchymal epithelial stem cells, triggering a cascade of molecular signals and 
      events (scarring, bronchiolar proliferation, abnormal remodelling) eventually 
      leading to severe and irreversible functional impairment. New pathogenic schemes 
      focus on the complex molecular mechanisms driving in a vicious circle the 
      different signalling pathways (e.g. Wnt/ -catenin, TGF-beta, caveolin-1, etc.) 
      potentially involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and irreversible lung 
      remodelling.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal 
      illness whose pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Recent evidence suggests 
      oxidative stress as a key player in the establishment/progression of lung 
      fibrosis in animal models and possibly in human IPF. The aim of the present study 
      was to characterize the cellular phenotype of fibroblasts derived from IPF 
      patients and identify underlying molecular mechanisms. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL 
      FINDINGS: We first analyzed the baseline differentiation features and growth 
      ability of primary lung fibroblasts derived from 7 histology proven IPF patients 
      and 4 control subjects at different culture passages. Then, we focused on the 
      redox state and related molecular pathways of IPF fibroblasts and investigated 
      the impact of oxidative stress in the establishment of the IPF phenotype. IPF 
      fibroblasts were differentiated into alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA)-positive 
      myofibroblasts, displayed a pro-fibrotic phenotype as expressing type-I collagen, 
      and proliferated lower than controls cells. The IPF phenotype was inducible upon 
      oxidative stress in control cells and was sensitive to ROS scavenging. IPF 
      fibroblasts also contained large excess of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to 
      the activation of an NADPH oxidase-like system, displayed higher levels of 
      tyrosine phosphorylated proteins and were more resistant to oxidative-stress 
      induced cell death. Interestingly, the IPF traits disappeared with time in 
      culture, indicating a transient effect of the initial trigger. 
      CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Robust expression of alpha-SMA and type-I collagen, high 
      and uniformly-distributed ROS levels, resistance to oxidative-stress induced cell 
      death and constitutive activation of tyrosine kinase(s) signalling are 
      distinctive features of the IPF phenotype. We suggest that this phenotype can be 
      used as a model to identify the initial trigger of IPF.

AB  - The authors investigated the role of resveratrol (RV), a natural poliphenolic 
      molecule with several biological activities, in transforming growth factor-beta 
      (TGF-beta)-induced proliferation and differentiation of ex vivo human pulmonary 
      fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. The effects of RV treatment were evaluated by 
      analyzing TGF-beta-induced alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) expression and collagen 
      production, as well as cell proliferation of both normal and idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF) lung fibroblasts. Results demonstrate that RV inhibits 
      TGF-beta-induced cell proliferation of both normal and pathological lung 
      fibroblasts, attenuates alpha-SMA expression at both the mRNA and protein levels, and 
      also inhibits intracellular collagen deposition. In order to understand the 
      molecular mechanisms, the authors also investigated the effects of RV treatment 
      on signaling pathways involved in TGF-beta-induced fibrosis. The authors show that 
      RV inhibited TGF-beta-induced phosphorylation of both extracellular signal-regulated 
      kinases (ERK1/2) and the serine/threonine kinase, Akt. Moreover, RV treatment 
      blocked the TGF-beta-induced decrease in phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) 
      expression levels.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal disease for which 
      no effective therapy exists to date. To identify the molecular mechanisms 
      underlying IPF, we performed comparative proteome analysis of lung tissue from 
      patients with sporadic IPF (n = 14) and human donor lungs (controls, n = 10) 
      using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF-MS. Eighty-nine 
      differentially expressed proteins were identified, from which 51 were 
      up-regulated and 38 down-regulated in IPF. Increased expression of markers for 
      the unfolded protein response (UPR), heat-shock proteins, and DNA damage stress 
      markers indicated a chronic cell stress-response in IPF lungs. By means of 
      immunohistochemistry, induction of UPR markers was encountered in type-II 
      alveolar epithelial cells of IPF but not of control lungs. In contrast, 
      up-regulation of heat-shock protein 27 (Hsp27) was exclusively observed in 
      proliferating bronchiolar basal cells and associated with aberrant 
      re-epithelialization at the bronchiolo-alveolar junctions. Among the 
      down-regulated proteins in IPF were antioxidants, members of the annexin family, 
      and structural epithelial proteins. In summary, our results indicate that IPF is 
      characterized by epithelial cell injury, apoptosis, and aberrant epithelial 
      proliferation.

AB  - Chronic lung diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
      (COPD), and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are all characterized by 
      structural changes of the airways and/or lungs that limit airflow and/or gas 
      exchange. Currently, there is no therapy available that adequately targets the 
      structural remodeling of the airways and lungs in these diseases. This 
      underscores the great need for insight into the mechanisms that underpin the 
      development of airway remodeling, fibrosis and emphysema in these diseases, in 
      order to identify suitable drug targets. It is increasingly evident that 
      structural cell-cell communication within the lung is central to the development 
      of remodeling, indicating that a more integrative approach should be considered 
      when studying molecular and cellular mechanisms of remodeling. Therefore, there 
      is a great need to study molecular and cellular physiological and 
      pathophysiological mechanisms in as much detail as possible, but with as little 
      as possible loss of the physiological context. Here, we will review the use of 
      models such as cellular co-culture, tissue culture, and lung slice culture, in 
      which cell-cell communication and tissue architecture are better preserved or 
      mimicked than in cell culture, and zoom in on the usefulness of molecular and 
      cellular biological tools in these complex model systems to read out or control 
      signaling and gene/protein regulation.

PG  - 1447-54
AB  - Pulmonary fibrosis is an unremitting degenerative lung disease that has an 
      associated high mortality. The major pathological features include the growth of 
      fibroblasts, emergence of myofibroblasts and their production of extracellular 
      matrix that distorts the peripheral lung tissue and impairs respiratory function. 
      Efforts to pharmacologically reduce inflammation, inhibit fibroblast growth, or 
      matrix synthesis have not been successful in ameliorating disease. Genetic 
      mutations associated with rare hereditary forms of interstitial lung disease 
      (ILD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) link definitive causes to this 
      enigmatic group of diseases. The generation of mouse models with similar genetic 
      lesions or deficiencies is providing insight into the mechanisms that lead to 
      fibrosis. Mutations that alter components of pulmonary surfactant or surfactant 
      homeostasis have been associated with specific forms of ILD and/or IPF. This 
      small but growing collection of IPF related surfactant dysfunction mutations 
      implicate respiratory epithelial cell injury as an early event in the molecular 
      pathogenesis and progression of fibrosis. Determining the mechanisms for 
      genetically defined examples of IPF should be informative for investigating the 
      larger segment of IPF where the underlying cause remains obscure.

TI  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a disorder of epithelial cell dysfunction.
PG  - 435-8
LID - 10.1097/MAJ.0b013e31821a9d8e [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by progressive dyspnea, 
      interstitial infiltrates in lung parenchyma and restriction on pulmonary function 
      testing. IPF is the most common and severe of the idiopathic interstitial 
      pneumonias, with most individuals progressing to respiratory failure. Multiple 
      lines of evidence reveal prominent roles for alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) in 
      disease. The current disease paradigm is that ongoing or repetitive injurious 
      stimuli in the presence of a genetic or acquired dysfunctional type II AEC 
      phenotype results in increased AEC injury/apoptosis, deficiencies in regeneration 
      of normal alveolar structure and aberrant lung repair and fibroblast activation, 
      leading to progressive fibrosis. Although the nature of injurious events and 
      processes involved in aberrant repair of the alveolar epithelium are not well 
      understood, ongoing investigations provide hope to better understand mechanisms 
      by which AECs maintain homeostasis or contribute to fibrosis. These strategies 
      may hold promise for developing novel treatment approaches for IPF.

TI  - Genetics in pulmonary fibrosis--familial cases provide clues to the pathogenesis 
      of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 439-43
LID - 10.1097/MAJ.0b013e31821a9d7a [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most common form of the idiopathic 
      interstitial pneumonias and remains a disease with a poor prognosis. Familial 
      interstitial pneumonia (FIP) occurs when 2 or more individuals from a given 
      family have an idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. FIP cases have been linked to 
      mutations in surfactant protein C, surfactant protein A2, telomerase reverse 
      transcriptase and telomerase RNA component. Together, mutations in these 4 genes 
      likely explain only 15% to 20% of FIP cases and are even less frequent in 
      sporadic IPF. However, dysfunctional aspects of the pathways that are involved 
      with these genes are present in sporadic forms of IPF even in the absence of 
      mutations, suggesting common underlying disease mechanisms. By serving as a 
      resource for identifying the current and future genetic links to disease, FIP 
      families hold great promise in defining IPF pathogenesis, potentially suggesting 
      targets for the development of future therapies.

TI  - Increased cell surface Fas expression is necessary and sufficient to sensitize 
      lung fibroblasts to Fas ligation-induced apoptosis: implications for fibroblast 
      accumulation in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 527-37
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1100447 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is associated with the accumulation of 
      collagen-secreting fibroblasts and myofibroblasts in the lung parenchyma. Many 
      mechanisms contribute to their accumulation, including resistance to apoptosis. 
      In previous work, we showed that exposure to the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha 
      and IFN-gamma reverses the resistance of lung fibroblasts to apoptosis. In this 
      study, we investigate the underlying mechanisms. Based on an interrogation of the 
      transcriptomes of unstimulated and TNF-alpha- and IFN-gamma-stimulated primary lung 
      fibroblasts and the lung fibroblast cell line MRC5, we show that among 
      Fas-signaling pathway molecules, Fas expression was increased  approximately 6-fold in an 
      NF-kappaB- and p38(mapk)-dependent fashion. Prevention of the increase in Fas 
      expression using Fas small interfering RNAs blocked the ability of TNF-alpha and 
      IFN-gamma to sensitize fibroblasts to Fas ligation-induced apoptosis, whereas 
      enforced adenovirus-mediated Fas overexpression was sufficient to overcome basal 
      resistance to Fas-induced apoptosis. Examination of lung tissues from IPF 
      patients revealed low to absent staining of Fas in fibroblastic cells of 
      fibroblast foci. Collectively, these findings suggest that increased expression 
      of Fas is necessary and sufficient to overcome the resistance of lung fibroblasts 
      to Fas-induced apoptosis. Our findings also suggest that approaches aimed at 
      increasing Fas expression by lung fibroblasts and myofibroblasts may be 
      therapeutically relevant in IPF.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Pulmonary fibrosis is a reparative response characterized by 
      accumulation of extracellular matrix in the lung parenchyma that may be observed 
      in end-stage sarcoidosis. This article will discuss the recent advancements in 
      the understanding of the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis in sarcoidosis in 
      comparison with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)/usual interstitial pneumonia 
      (UIP). RECENT FINDINGS: A recent study examined clinical, radiographic, and 
      histopathologic findings of end-stage sarcoidosis patients with lung fibrosis who 
      underwent lung transplantation. The authors found many of the patients to have 
      moderate-to-severe interstitial pneumonitis in some cases with UIP considered to 
      be atypical of end-stage sarcoidosis. Furthermore, these patients had diagnosis 
      of sarcoidosis for a shorter time prior to transplant compared with individuals 
      without interstitial pneumonitis (mean 4.8 years vs. 23.3 years). Another study 
      found a promoter polymorphism in prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), 
      -765G>C, to be associated with susceptibility and increased risk for pulmonary 
      fibrosis in sarcoidosis in the white population compared with healthy controls. 
      An altered Sp1/Sp3 binding to the -765 region has been proposed as a possible 
      mechanism for reduced PTGS2 expression. SUMMARY: A subset of patients with 
      sarcoidosis that progresses to pulmonary fibrosis may share some similar 
      mechanistic and morphologic aberrations with IPF/UIP. Future studies are needed 
      to examine the significance of chronic interstitial pneumonitits and UIP pattern 
      in fibrotic sarcoidosis as a potential marker for progressive disease, and the 
      roles of PTGS2 polymorphism in various ethnic groups and Sp1/Sp3 binding in other 
      fibrotic lung diseases.

TI  - Severe lung fibrosis requires an invasive fibroblast phenotype regulated by 
      hyaluronan and CD44.
PG  - 1459-71
LID - 10.1084/jem.20102510 [doi]
AB  - Tissue fibrosis is a major cause of morbidity, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
      (IPF) is a terminal illness characterized by unremitting matrix deposition in the 
      lung. The mechanisms that control progressive fibrosis are unknown. 
      Myofibroblasts accumulate at sites of tissue remodeling and produce extracellular 
      matrix components such as collagen and hyaluronan (HA) that ultimately compromise 
      organ function. We found that targeted overexpression of HAS2 (HA synthase 2) by 
      myofibroblasts produced an aggressive phenotype leading to severe lung fibrosis 
      and death after bleomycin-induced injury. Fibroblasts isolated from transgenic 
      mice overexpressing HAS2 showed a greater capacity to invade matrix. Conditional 
      deletion of HAS2 in mesenchymal cells abrogated the invasive fibroblast 
      phenotype, impeded myofibroblast accumulation, and inhibited the development of 
      lung fibrosis. Both the invasive phenotype and the progressive fibrosis were 
      inhibited in the absence of CD44. Treatment with a blocking antibody to CD44 
      reduced lung fibrosis in mice in vivo. Finally, fibroblasts isolated from 
      patients with IPF exhibited an invasive phenotype that was also dependent on HAS2 
      and CD44. Understanding the mechanisms leading to an invasive fibroblast 
      phenotype could lead to novel approaches to the treatment of disorders 
      characterized by severe tissue fibrosis.

TI  - Matrix metalloproteinase 3 is a mediator of pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 1733-45
LID - 10.1016/j.ajpath.2011.06.041 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) may be triggered by epithelial injury that 
      results in aberrant production of growth factors, cytokines, and proteinases, 
      leading to proliferation of myofibroblasts, excess deposition of collagen, and 
      destruction of the lung architecture. The precise mechanisms and key signaling 
      mediators responsible for this aberrant repair process remain unclear. We 
      assessed the importance of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) in the pathogenesis 
      of IPF through i) determination of MMP-3 expression in patients with IPF, ii) in 
      vivo experiments examining the relevance of MMP-3 in experimental models of 
      fibrosis, and iii) in vitro experiments to elucidate possible mechanisms of 
      action. Gene expression analysis, quantitative RT-PCR, and Western blot analysis 
      of explanted human lungs revealed enhanced expression of MMP-3 in IPF, compared 
      with control. Transient adenoviral vector-mediated expression of recombinant 
      MMP-3 in rat lung resulted in accumulation of myofibroblasts and pulmonary 
      fibrosis. Conversely, MMP-3-null mice were protected against bleomycin-induced 
      pulmonary fibrosis. In vitro treatment of cultured lung epithelial cells with 
      purified MMP-3 resulted in activation of the beta-catenin signaling pathway, via 
      cleavage of E-cadherin, and induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. These 
      processes were inhibited in bleomycin-treated MMP-3-null mice, as assessed by 
      cytosolic translocation of beta-catenin and cyclin D1 expression. These observations 
      support a novel role for MMP-3 in the pathogenesis of IPF, through activation of 
      beta-catenin signaling and induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

AB  - Over the course of the past decade, increasing evidence has implicated alveolar 
      epithelial cell injury and dysfunction in the pathogenesis of idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Genetic factors, cigarette smoking, and other 
      environmental exposures have been identified as potential factors leading to a 
      population of vulnerable alveolar epithelial cells. In addition, molecular 
      techniques have demonstrated herpesviruses are commonly detectable in the lungs 
      of patients with IPF, raising suspicion that, in the setting of a vulnerable 
      alveolar epithelium, lytic (or latent) herpesvirus infection may act as a "second 
      hit" leading to the development of pulmonary fibrosis. Intriguingly, in vivo 
      modeling has shown that herpesvirus infection induces or worsens lung fibrosis 
      when combined with immunodeficiency or other injurious stimuli. Here, we discuss 
      potential mechanisms through which herpesvirus infection may contribute to the 
      pathogenesis of IPF. Ultimately, antiviral therapy may hold promise for halting 
      the progression of this deadly disease.

AB  - Fibrotic remodelling of lung parenchymal and airway compartments is the major 
      contributor to life-threatening organ dysfunction in chronic lung diseases such 
      as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease 
      (COPD). Since transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) is believed to play a key 
      role in disease pathogenesis and markers of oxidative stress are also commonly 
      detected in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from such patients we sought to 
      investigate whether both factors might be interrelated. Here we investigated the 
      hypothesis that oxidative stress to the lung epithelium promotes fibrotic repair 
      by driving epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) via the augmentation of 
      TGF-beta1. We show that in response to 400muM hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) A549 
      cells, used a model for alveolar epithelium, and human primary bronchial 
      epithelial cells (PBECs) undergo EMT displaying morphology changes, decreased 
      expression of epithelial markers (E-cadherin and ZO-1), increased expression of 
      mesenchymal markers (vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin) as well as increased 
      secretion of extracelluar matrix components. The same oxidative stress also 
      promotes expression of TGF-beta1. Inhibition of TGF-beta1 signalling as well as 
      treatment with antioxidants such as phenyl tert-butylnitrone (PBN) and superoxide 
      dismutase 3 (SOD3) prevent the oxidative stress driven EMT-like changes described 
      above. Interventions also inhibited EMT-like changes. This study identifies a 
      link between oxidative stress, TGF-beta1 and EMT in lung epithelium and highlights 
      the potential for antioxidant therapies to limit EMT and its potential 
      contribution to chronic lung disease.

TI  - Interactions between beta-catenin and transforming growth factor-beta signaling

      protein (CBP).

AB  - Interactions between transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and Wnt are crucial to 
      many biological processes, although specific targets, rationale for divergent 
      outcomes (differentiation versus block of epithelial proliferation versus 
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)) and precise mechanisms in many cases 
      remain unknown. We investigated beta-catenin-dependent and transforming growth 
      factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) interactions in pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) in 
      the context of EMT and pulmonary fibrosis. We previously demonstrated that 
      ICG-001, a small molecule specific inhibitor of the beta-catenin/CBP (but not 
      beta-catenin/p300) interaction, ameliorates and reverses pulmonary fibrosis and 
      inhibits TGF-beta1-mediated alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and collagen induction in 
      AEC. We now demonstrate that TGF-beta1 induces LEF/TCF TOPFLASH reporter activation 
      and nuclear beta-catenin accumulation, while LiCl augments TGF-beta-induced alpha-SMA 
      expression, further confirming co-operation between beta-catenin- and 
      TGF-beta-dependent signaling pathways. Inhibition and knockdown of Smad3, knockdown 
      of beta-catenin and overexpression of ICAT abrogated effects of TGF-beta1 on alpha-SMA 
      transcription/expression, indicating a requirement for beta-catenin in these 
      Smad3-dependent effects. Following TGF-beta treatment, co-immunoprecipitation 
      demonstrated direct interaction between endogenous Smad3 and beta-catenin, while 
      chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-re-ChIP identified spatial and temporal 
      regulation of alpha-SMA via complex formation among Smad3, beta-catenin, and CBP. 
      ICG-001 inhibited alpha-SMA expression/transcription in response to TGF-beta as well as 
      alpha-SMA promoter occupancy by beta-catenin and CBP, demonstrating a previously unknown 
      requisite TGF-beta1/beta-catenin/CBP-mediated pro-EMT signaling pathway. Clinical 
      relevance was shown by beta-catenin/Smad3 co-localization and CBP expression in AEC 
      of IPF patients. These findings suggest a new therapeutic approach to pulmonary 
      fibrosis by specifically uncoupling CBP/catenin-dependent signaling downstream of 
      TGF-beta.

TI  - Periostin, a matricellular protein, plays a role in the induction of chemokines 
      in pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 677-86
LID - 10.1165/rcmb.2011-0115OC [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive, and usually fatal 
      form of interstitial lung disease (ILD). The precise molecular mechanisms of IPF 
      remain poorly understood. However, analyses of mice receiving bleomycin (BLM) as 
      a model of IPF established the importance of preceding inflammation for the 
      formation of fibrosis. Periostin is a recently characterized matricellular 
      protein involved in modulating cell functions. We recently found that periostin 
      is highly expressed in the lung tissue of patients with IPF, suggesting that it 
      may play a role in the process of pulmonary fibrosis. To explore this 
      possibility, we administered BLM to periostin-deficient mice, and they 
      subsequently showed a reduction of pulmonary fibrosis. We next determined whether 
      this result was caused by a decrease in the preceding recruitment of neutrophils 
      and macrophages in the lungs because of the lower production of chemokines and 
      proinflammatory cytokines. We performed an in vitro analysis of chemokine 
      production in lung fibroblasts, which indicated that periostin-deficient 
      fibroblasts produced few or no chemokines in response to TNF-alpha compared with 
      control samples, at least partly explaining the lack of inflammatory response 
      and, therefore, fibrosis after BLM administration to periostin-deficient mice. In 
      addition, we confirmed that periostin is highly expressed in the lung tissue of 
      chemotherapeutic-agent-induced ILD as well as of patients with IPF. Taking these 
      results together, we conclude that periostin plays a unique role as an inducer of 
      chemokines to recruit neutrophils and macrophages important in the process of 
      pulmonary fibrosis in BLM-administered model mice. Our results suggest a 
      therapeutic potential for periostin in IPF and drug-induced ILD.

TI  - Emerging evidence for endoplasmic reticulum stress in the pathogenesis of 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - L721-9
LID - 10.1152/ajplung.00410.2011 [doi]
AB  - While the factors that regulate the onset and progression of idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF) are incompletely understood, recent investigations have revealed 
      that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activation of the unfolded protein 
      response (UPR) are prominent in alveolar epithelial cells in this disease. 
      Initial observations linking ER stress and IPF were made in cases of familial 
      interstitial pneumonia (FIP), the familial form of IPF, in a family with a 
      mutation in surfactant protein C (SFTPC). Subsequent studies involving lung 
      biopsy specimens revealed that ER stress markers are highly expressed in the 
      alveolar epithelium in IPF and FIP. Recent mouse modeling has revealed that 
      induction of ER stress in the alveolar epithelium predisposed to enhanced lung 
      fibrosis after treatment with bleomycin, which is mediated at least in part by 
      increased alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) apoptosis. Emerging data also indicate 
      that ER stress in AECs could impact fibrotic remodeling by altering inflammatory 
      responses and inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Although the cause of 
      ER stress in IPF remains unknown, common environmental exposures such as 
      herpesviruses, inhaled particulates, and cigarette smoke induce ER stress and are 
      candidates for contributing to AEC dysfunction by this mechanism. Together, 
      investigations to date suggest that ER stress predisposes to AEC dysfunction and 
      subsequent lung fibrosis. However, many questions remain regarding the role of ER 
      stress in initiation and progression of lung fibrosis, including whether ER 
      stress or the UPR could be targeted for therapeutic benefit.

TI  - STAT3-mediated signaling dysregulates lung fibroblast-myofibroblast activation 
      and differentiation in UIP/IPF.
PG  - 1398-412
LID - 10.1016/j.ajpath.2011.12.022 [doi]
AB  - STAT3 is a latent transcription factor that plays a role in regulating fibroblast 
      function in fibrotic lung diseases. To further understand the role of STAT3 in 
      the phenotypic divergence and function of human lung fibroblasts (LFs), we 
      investigated the effect of basal and cytokine-induced STAT3 activity on indices 
      of LF differentiation and activation, including expression of alpha-smooth muscle 
      actin (alpha-SMA), collagen, and adhesion molecules Thy-1/CD90 and alpha(v) beta(3) and beta(5) 
      integrins. We identified a population of fibroblasts from usual interstitial 
      pneumonia (UIP)/idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) lungs characterized by 
      constitutively phosphorylated STAT3, lower proliferation rates, and diminished 
      expression of alpha-SMA, Thy-1/CD90, and beta(3) integrins compared with control LFs. 
      Staining of UIP lung biopsy specimens demonstrated that phosphorylated STAT3 was 
      not present in alpha-SMA-positive fibroblastic foci but was observed in the nuclei of 
      cells located in the areas of dense fibrosis. STAT3 activation in LFs did not 
      significantly influence basal or transforming growth factor beta(1)-induced collagen 
      I expression but inhibited expression of alpha-SMA, Thy-1/CD90, and alphav beta(3) 
      integrins. Suppression of STAT3 signaling diminished resistance of IPF LFs to 
      staurosporine-induced apoptosis and responsiveness to transforming growth factor 
      beta(1) but increased basal alpha-SMA and restored beta(3) integrin expression in LFs via 
      an ALK-5-dependent, SMAD3/7-independent mechanism. These data suggest that STAT3 
      activation regulates several pathways in human LFs associated with normal wound 
      healing, whereas aberrant STAT3 signaling plays a critical role in UIP/IPF 
      pathogenesis.

TI  - hTERT mutations associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis affect telomerase 
      activity, telomere length, and cell growth by distinct mechanisms.
PG  - 482-90
LID - 10.1111/j.1474-9726.2012.00810.x [doi]
AB  - Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein reverse transcriptase (RT) that synthesizes 
      specific DNA repeats, or telomeric DNA, at the ends of chromosomes. Telomerase is 
      minimally composed of a protein subunit, TERT, and an RNA component, TR. Aberrant 
      telomerase activity has been associated with most human cancers and several 
      premature aging diseases, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a chronic, 
      progressive, and fatal lung disease characterized by alveolar epithelial cell 
      damage and fibrosis. Our study focuses on three hTERT mutations that were 
      identified in a subset of patients with IPF, in which these patients also 
      exhibited shorter telomeres compared with age-matched controls. We characterized 
      how three IPF-associated hTERT mutations, V144M, R865C, and R865H, affected 
      telomerase function both in vitro and in human cells. We demonstrated that the 
      R865 residue is crucial for repeat addition processivity and thus telomere 
      synthesis in telomerase-positive 293 cells and telomerase-negative BJ cells, 
      consistent with its location in the hTERT nucleotide-binding motif. In contrast, 
      while the V144M mutant did not exhibit any biochemical defects, this mutant was 
      unable to elongate telomeres in human cells. As a result, our studies have 
      identified hTERT V144 and R865 as two critical residues required for proper 
      telomerase function in cells. Together, this may explain how inherited hTERT 
      mutations can lead to shortened telomeres in patients with IPF and, thus, provide 
      further insight into the role of naturally occurring telomerase mutations in the 
      pathophysiology of certain age-related disease states.

TI  - Intratracheal bleomycin causes airway remodeling and airflow obstruction in mice.
PG  - 135-46
LID - 10.3109/01902148.2012.658595 [doi]
AB  - In addition to parenchymal fibrosis, fibrotic remodeling of the distal airways 
      has been reported in interstitial lung diseases. Mechanisms of airway wall 
      remodeling, which occurs in a variety of chronic lung diseases, are not well 
      defined and current animal models are limited. The authors quantified airway 
      remodeling in lung sections from subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
      (IPF) and controls. To investigate intratracheal bleomycin as a potential animal 
      model for fibrotic airway remodeling, the authors evaluated lungs from C57BL/6 
      mice after bleomycin treatment by histologic scoring for fibrosis and 
      peribronchial inflammation, morphometric evaluation of subepithelial connective 
      tissue volume density, TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP-mediated 
      nick-end labeling) assay, and immunohistochemistry for transforming growth factor 
      beta1 (TGFbeta1), TGFbeta2, and the fibroblast marker S100A4. Lung mechanics were 
      determined at 3 weeks post bleomycin. IPF lungs had small airway remodeling with 
      increased bronchial wall thickness compared to controls. Similarly, 
      bleomycin-treated mice developed dose-dependent airway wall inflammation and 
      fibrosis and greater airflow resistance after high-dose bleomycin. Increased 
      TUNEL(+) bronchial epithelial cells and peribronchial inflammation were noted by 
      1 week, and expression of TGFbeta1 and TGFbeta2 and accumulation of S100A4(+) 
      fibroblasts correlated with airway remodeling in a bleomycin dose-dependent 
      fashion. IPF is characterized by small airway remodeling in addition to 
      parenchymal fibrosis, a pattern also seen with intratracheal bleomycin. Bronchial 
      remodeling from intratracheal bleomycin follows a cascade of events including 
      epithelial cell injury, airway inflammation, profibrotic cytokine expression, 
      fibroblast accumulation, and peribronchial fibrosis. Thus, this model can be 
      utilized to investigate mechanisms of airway remodeling.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disease of unknown etiology with 
      considerable morbidity and mortality. Cigarette smoking is one of the most 
      recognized risk factors for development of IPF. Furthermore, recent work suggests 
      that smoking may have a detrimental effect on survival of patients with IPF. The 
      mechanism by which smoking may contribute to the pathogenesis of IPF is largely 
      unknown. However, accumulating evidence suggests that increased oxidative stress 
      might promote disease progression in IPF patients who are current and former 
      smokers. In this review, potential mechanisms by which cigarette smoking affects 
      IPF, the effects of cigarette smoking on accelerated loss of lung function in 
      patients with IPF, key genetic studies evaluating the potential candidate genes 
      and gene-environment (smoking) interaction, diagnosis, and treatment with 
      emphasis on recently closed and ongoing clinical trials are presented.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by profound 
      changes in the lung phenotype including excessive extracellular matrix 
      deposition, myofibroblast foci, alveolar epithelial cell hyperplasia and 
      extensive remodeling. The role of epigenetic changes in determining the lung 
      phenotype in IPF is unknown. In this study we determine whether IPF lungs exhibit 
      an altered global methylation profile. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 
      Immunoprecipitated methylated DNA from 12 IPF lungs, 10 lung adenocarcinomas and 
      10 normal histology lungs was hybridized to Agilent human CpG Islands Microarrays 
      and data analysis was performed using BRB-Array Tools and DAVID Bioinformatics 
      Resources software packages. Array results were validated using the EpiTYPER 
      MassARRAY platform for 3 CpG islands. 625 CpG islands were differentially 
      methylated between IPF and control lungs with an estimated False Discovery Rate 
      less than 5%. The genes associated with the differentially methylated CpG islands 
      are involved in regulation of apoptosis, morphogenesis and cellular biosynthetic 
      processes. The expression of three genes (STK17B, STK3 and HIST1H2AH) with 
      hypomethylated promoters was increased in IPF lungs. Comparison of IPF 
      methylation patterns to lung cancer or control samples, revealed that IPF lungs 
      display an intermediate methylation profile, partly similar to lung cancer and 
      partly similar to control with 402 differentially methylated CpG islands 
      overlapping between IPF and cancer. Despite their similarity to cancer, IPF lungs 
      did not exhibit hypomethylation of long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE-1) 
      retrotransposon while lung cancer samples did, suggesting that the global 
      hypomethylation observed in cancer was not typical of IPF. 
      CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results provide evidence that epigenetic changes in 
      IPF are widespread and potentially important. The partial similarity to cancer 
      may signify similar pathogenetic mechanisms while the differences constitute IPF 
      or cancer specific changes. Elucidating the role of these specific changes will 
      potentially allow better understanding of the pathogenesis of IPF.

TI  - Low alpha(2)beta(1) integrin function enhances the proliferation of fibroblasts from 
      patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis by activation of the beta-catenin 
      pathway.
PG  - 222-33
LID - 10.1016/j.ajpath.2012.03.034 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and incurable 
      fibroproliferative disorder characterized by unrelenting proliferation of 
      fibroblasts and their deposition of collagen within alveoli, resulting in 
      permanently scarred, nonfunctional airspaces. Normally, polymerized collagen 
      suppresses fibroblast proliferation and serves as a physiological restraint to 
      limit fibroproliferation after tissue injury. The IPF fibroblast, however, is a 
      pathologically altered cell that has acquired the capacity to elude the 
      proliferation-suppressive effects of polymerized collagen. The mechanism for this 
      phenomenon remains incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that expression 
      of alpha(2)beta(1) integrin, a major collagen receptor, is pathologically low in IPF 
      fibroblasts interacting with polymerized collagen. Low integrin expression in IPF 
      fibroblasts is associated with a failure to induce PP2A phosphatase activity, 
      resulting in abnormally high levels of phosphorylated (inactive) GSK-3beta and high 
      levels of active beta-catenin in the nucleus. Knockdown of beta-catenin in IPF 
      fibroblasts inhibits their ability to proliferate on collagen. Interdiction of 
      alpha(2)beta(1) integrin in control fibroblasts reproduces the IPF phenotype and leads 
      to the inability of these cells to activate PP2A, resulting in high levels of 
      phosphorylated GSK-3beta and active beta-catenin and in enhanced proliferation on 
      collagen. Our findings indicate that the IPF fibroblast phenotype is 
      characterized by low alpha(2)beta(1) integrin expression, resulting in a failure of 
      integrin to activate PP2A phosphatase, which permits inappropriate activation of 
      the beta-catenin pathway.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal disease that is unresponsive to 
      current therapies and characterized by excessive collagen deposition and 
      subsequent fibrosis. While inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-6, 
      are elevated in IPF, the molecular mechanisms that underlie this disease are 
      incompletely understood, although the development of fibrosis is believed to 
      depend on canonical transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta signalling. We examined 
      bleomycin-induced inflammation and fibrosis in mice carrying a mutation in the 
      shared IL-6 family receptor gp130. Using genetic complementation, we directly 
      correlate the extent of IL-6-mediated, excessive Stat3 activity with inflammatory 
      infiltrates in the lung and the severity of fibrosis in corresponding gp130(757F) 
      mice. The extent of fibrosis was attenuated in B lymphocyte-deficient 
      gp130(757F);microMT(-/-) compound mutant mice, but fibrosis still occurred in their 
      Smad3(-/-) counterparts consistent with the capacity of excessive Stat3 activity 
      to induce collagen 1alpha1 gene transcription independently of canonical TGF-beta/Smad3 
      signalling. These findings are of therapeutic relevance, since we confirmed 
      abundant STAT3 activation in fibrotic lungs from IPF patients and showed that 
      genetic reduction of Stat3 protected mice from bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis.

TI  - Altered DNA methylation profile in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 525-35
LID - 10.1164/rccm.201201-0077OC [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mechanism, which often 
      occurs in response to environmental stimuli and is crucial in regulating gene 
      expression. It is likely that epigenetic alterations contribute to pathogenesis 
      in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). OBJECTIVES: To determine the DNA 
      methylation changes in IPF and their effects on gene expression. METHODS: Total 
      DNA methylation and DNA methyltransferase expression were compared in IPF and 
      normal control lung tissues. IPF and normal tissues were subjected to comparative 
      analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation and RNA expression using DNA 
      hybridization to the Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip and RNA hybridization 
      to Illumina HumanHT-12 BeadChip. Functional analyses of differentially expressed 
      and differentially methylated genes were done. Selected genes were validated at 
      DNA, RNA, and protein levels. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: DNA methylation 
      status was altered in IPF. IPF samples demonstrated higher DNA methyltransferase 
      expression without observed alterations in global DNA methylation. Genome-wide 
      differences in DNA methylation status and RNA expression were demonstrated by 
      array hybridization. Among the genes whose DNA methylation status and RNA 
      expression were both significantly altered, 16 genes were hypermethylated in DNA 
      associated with decreased mRNA expression or vice versa. We validated CLDN5, 
      ZNF467, TP53INP1, and DDAH1 genes at the level of DNA methylation status, RNA, 
      and protein-level expression. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in DNA methylation correspond 
      to altered mRNA expression of a number of genes, some with known and others with 
      previously uncharacterized roles in IPF, suggesting that DNA methylation is 
      important in the pathogenesis of IPF.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating lung disease of unknown 
      etiology. A conspicuous feature is the formation and persistence of 
      fibroblastic/myofibroblastic foci throughout the lung parenchyma. Mechanisms 
      remain unknown, but data indicate that fibroblasts acquire an antiapoptotic 
      phenotype. We hypothesized that transcriptional silencing of proapoptotic genes 
      may be implicated, and accordingly we evaluated the epigenetic regulation of 
      p14(ARF). The expression of p14(ARF) was analyzed by RT-PCR in IPF (n = 8) and 
      normal derived fibroblasts (n = 4) before and after treatment with 
      5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza) and trichostatin A (TSA). p14(ARF) gene promoter 
      methylation was determined by methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR) and by DNA 
      digestion with endonuclease McrBc, which cleaves 50% of methylated CpG. Apoptosis 
      was evaluated by Annexin-V and nuclear staining. p14(ARF) expression was 
      significantly decreased in four of the eight IPF fibroblasts lines, which was 
      restored after 5-aza treatment. No changes were found with TSA. MS-PCR of 
      bisulfite-treated genomic DNA showed a correlation between the reduced expression 
      of p14(ARF) and the presence of hypermethylated promoter. No amplification was 
      observed in the DNA treated with the McrBc enzyme, corroborating promoter 
      hypermethylation. p14(ARF)-hypermethylated IPF fibroblasts were significantly 
      more resistant to staurosporine-and S-nitrosoglutathione-induced apoptosis 
      compared with normal and nonmethylated IPF fibroblasts (P < 0.01) and showed 
      reduced levels of p53. Resistance to apoptosis was provoked in fibroblasts when 
      p14(ARF) expression was inhibited by siRNA (P < 0.05). These findings demonstrate 
      that many IPF fibroblasts have reduced expression of the proapoptotic p14(ARF) 
      attributable to promoter hypermethylation and indicate that epigenetic mechanisms 
      may underlie their resistance to apoptosis.

TI  - TGF-beta1 induces tissue factor expression in human lung fibroblasts in a 
      PI3K/JNK/Akt-dependent and AP-1-dependent manner.
PG  - 614-27
LID - 10.1165/rcmb.2012-0097OC [doi]
AB  - The disturbance of hemostatic balance, associated with increased tissue factor 
      (TF) expression and activity, occurs in the lungs of patients with idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the 
      regulation of TF expression under profibrotic conditions have not been assessed. 
      We found that transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) markedly enhanced TF 
      expression in primary human lung fibroblasts (HLFs), whereas platelet-derived 
      growth factor (PDGF)-BB and IGF (insulin-like growth factor)-1 showed only a 
      moderate effect, and PDGB-CC exerted no effect. TGF-beta1-induced TF expression 
      correlated with its elevated cell-surface activity, it required de novo gene 
      transcription and protein synthesis, and it was dependent on JNK and Akt 
      activity, because pharmacological inhibition or the knockdown of the previously 
      mentioned kinases prevented TF synthesis. Exposure of HLFs to TGF-beta1 activated 
      JNK in a PI3K-dependent manner and induced Akt phosphorylation at threonine 308 
      and serine 473, but did not change the phosphorylation status of threonine 450. 
      Akt phosphorylation at serine 473 correlated with JNK activity, and 
      co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed a direct interaction between JNK and Akt. 
      Furthermore, TGF-beta1-induced TF expression required the recruitment of c-Fos and 
      JunD into a heterodimeric activator protein (AP)-1 complex. Moreover, strong 
      immunoreactivity for phosphorylated Akt and JNK as well as c-Fos and JunD was 
      observed in fibroblasts and myofibroblasts in IPF lungs. In conclusion, 
      PI3K/JNK/Akt and AP-1 synergize to induce TF expression in HLFs after TGF-beta1 
      challenge. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms 
      responsible for the regulation of TF expression, and open new perspectives on the 
      treatment of pulmonary fibrosis and other diseases characterized by the 
      inappropriate expression of this cell-surface receptor.

      cancer biology.

AB  - The fibrotic process that characterizes idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is 
      commonly considered the result of a recurrent injury to the alveolar epithelium 
      followed by an uncontrolled proliferation of fibroblasts. However, based on 
      considerable scientific evidence, it has been recently hypothesized that IPF 
      might be considered a neoproliferative disorder of the lung because this disease 
      exhibits several pathogenic features similar to cancer. Indeed, epigenetic and 
      genetic abnormalities, altered cell-to-cell communications, uncontrolled 
      proliferation, and abnormal activation of specific signal transduction pathways 
      are biological hallmarks that characterize the pathogenesis of IPF and cancer. 
      IPF remains a disease marked by a survival of 3 years, and little therapeutic 
      progress has been made in the last few years, underlining the urgent need to 
      improve research and to change our approach to the comprehension of this disease. 
      The concept of IPF as a cancer-like disease may be helpful in identifying new 
      pathogenic mechanisms that can be borrowed from cancer biology, potentially 
      leading to different and more effective therapeutic approaches. Such vision will 
      hopefully increase the awareness of this disease among the public and the 
      scientific community.

LID - 10.1513/pats.201201-002AW [doi]
AB  - Patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) survive a median of 3 years 
      after diagnosis, but a high degree of variability in longitudinal disease 
      progression has been observed. Unfortunately, physiology and clinical parameters 
      determined at the time of diagnosis have proven inaccurate in predicting the rate 
      at which IPF ultimately progresses. A mechanistic explanation for disease 
      progression in patients with IPF is presently unclear, but we have recently shown 
      that hypomethylated CpG DNA drives the rapid progression of fibrotic lung disease 
      through the differentiation of pulmonary fibroblasts into myofibroblasts through 
      a TLR9-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, we recently reported that the clinical 
      progression of IPF might be a consequence of aberrant microRNA processing. Using 
      this framework of data, we are presently addressing the following specific 
      hypothesis: hypomethylated CpG DNA activation in pulmonary fibroblasts leads to 
      aberrant micro RNA processing, thereby promoting the rapid progression of IPF.

TI  - Genetic characterization of a Chinese family with familial idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis.
PG  - 1945-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic inflammatory 
      interstitial lung disease with an unknown cause. Recent studies have shown that 
      genetic factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of IPF. METHODS: To 
      explore the genetic background of patients with IPF, a candidate gene approach 
      was employed to screen for mutations in seven genes among members with familial 
      IPF in mainland of China. RESULTS: Within six of the candidate genes, a total of 
      31 point mutations were identified. Among the missense mutations, the SFTPA1 exon 
      6 CAG > AAG (Gln238Lys) and SFTPB exon 2 CAC > CCC (His2Pro) mutations caused 
      changes in the physical and chemical properties of amino acids. Each sequence 
      alteration was identified in sporadic IPF patients, control specimens (pneumonia 
      patients and healthy persons). Genotype frequencies and allele frequencies of 
      codon 238 in exon 6 of SFTPA1 were noted significantly higher in patients with 
      IPF than those in other two control subjects. The computational protein structure 
      prediction by protein homology modeling confirmed differences in 
      three-dimensional structure between mutant SFTPA1 and original SFTPA1. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Although the functions of the mutant candidate genes vary, these 
      genes may ultimately result in damage to alveolar epithelial cells, initiating 
      the progress of pulmonary fibrosis. In particular, while pathophysiological 
      mechanisms need to be illustrated, the Gln238Lys missense variant of exon 6 in 
      the SFTPA1 may have potential susceptibility in the development of IPF, which was 
      shown in patients with sporadic IPF with a statistically higher frequency.

TI  - Hypoxia-induced DNA hypermethylation in human pulmonary fibroblasts is associated 
      with Thy-1 promoter methylation and the development of a pro-fibrotic phenotype.
PG  - 74
LID - 10.1186/1465-9921-13-74 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pulmonary fibrosis is a debilitating and lethal disease with no 
      effective treatment options. Understanding the pathological processes at play 
      will direct the application of novel therapeutic avenues. Hypoxia has been 
      implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis yet the precise mechanism by 
      which it contributes to disease progression remains to be fully elucidated. It 
      has been shown that chronic hypoxia can alter DNA methylation patterns in 
      tumour-derived cell lines. This epigenetic alteration can induce changes in 
      cellular phenotype with promoter methylation being associated with gene 
      silencing. Of particular relevance to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the 
      observation that Thy-1 promoter methylation is associated with a myofibroblast 
      phenotype where loss of Thy-1 occurs alongside increased alpha smooth muscle 
      actin (alpha-SMA) expression. The initial aim of this study was to determine whether 
      hypoxia regulates DNA methylation in normal human lung fibroblasts (CCD19Lu). As 
      it has been reported that hypoxia suppresses Thy-1 expression during lung 
      development we also studied the effect of hypoxia on Thy-1 promoter methylation 
      and gene expression. METHODS: CCD19Lu were grown for up to 8 days in hypoxia and 
      assessed for global changes in DNA methylation using flow cytometry. Real-time 
      PCR was used to quantify expression of Thy-1, alpha-SMA, collagen I and III. Genomic 
      DNA was bisulphite treated and methylation specific PCR (MSPCR) was used to 
      examine the methylation status of the Thy-1 promoter. RESULTS: Significant global 
      hypermethylation was detected in hypoxic fibroblasts relative to normoxic 
      controls and was accompanied by increased expression of myofibroblast markers. 
      Thy-1 mRNA expression was suppressed in hypoxic cells, which was restored with 
      the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. MSPCR revealed that Thy-1 became 
      methylated following fibroblast exposure to 1% O2. CONCLUSION: These data suggest 
      that global and gene-specific changes in DNA methylation may play an important 
      role in fibroblast function in hypoxia.

AB  - There is clear evidence that environmental exposures and genetic predisposition 
      contribute to the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Cigarette 
      smoking increases the risk of developing IPF several-fold, as do other exposures 
      such as metal-fume and wood-dust exposure. Occupations that increase the risk of 
      IPF are agricultural work, hairdressing, and stone polishing, supporting the role 
      of environmental exposure in disease pathogenesis. Genetic predisposition to IPF 
      is evident from its familial aggregation and the fact that pulmonary fibrosis 
      develops in several rare genetic disorders. Mutations in surfactant proteins lead 
      to pulmonary fibrosis and are associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress in 
      alveolar type II epithelial cells. Mutations in telomerase have been found in 
      several families with IPF, and shortened telomeres are found in sporadic cases of 
      IPF. A common variant in mucin 5B predisposes to both familial and sporadic IPF 
      and is present in the majority of cases, indicating sporadic IPF occurs in those 
      with genetic predisposition.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and lethal disease of 
      unknown etiology and uncertain pathogenic mechanisms. Recent studies indicate 
      that the pathogenesis of the disease may involve the abnormal expression of 
      certain developmental pathways. Here we evaluated the expression of Sonic 
      Hedgehog (SHH), Patched-1, Smoothened, and transcription factors 
      glioma-associated oncogene homolog (GLI)1 and GLI2 by RT-PCR, as well as their 
      localization in IPF and normal lungs by immunohistochemistry. The effects of SHH 
      on fibroblast proliferation, migration, collagen and fibronectin production, and 
      apoptosis were analyzed by WST-1, Boyden chamber chemotaxis, RT-PCR, Sircol, and 
      annexin V-propidium iodide binding assays, respectively. Our results showed that 
      all the main components of the Sonic signaling pathway were overexpressed in IPF 
      lungs. With the exception of Smoothened, they were also upregulated in IPF 
      fibroblasts. SHH and GLI2 localized to epithelial cells, whereas Patched-1, 
      Smoothened, and GLI1 were observed mainly in fibroblasts and inflammatory cells. 
      No staining was detected in normal lungs. Recombinant SHH increased fibroblast 
      proliferation (P < 0.05), collagen synthesis, (2.5 +/- 0.2 vs. 4.5 +/- 1.0 mug of 
      collagen/ml; P < 0.05), fibronectin expression (2-3-fold over control), and 
      migration (190.3 +/- 12.4% over control, P < 0.05). No effect was observed on 
      alpha-smooth muscle actin expression. SHH protected lung fibroblasts from 
      TNF-alpha/IFN-gamma/Fas-induced apoptosis (14.5 +/- 3.2% vs. 37.3 +/- 7.2%, P < 0.0001). This 
      protection was accompanied by modifications in several apoptosis-related 
      proteins, including increased expression of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis. 
      These findings indicate that the SHH pathway is activated in IPF lungs and that 
      SHH may contribute to IPF pathogenesis by increasing the proliferation, 
      migration, extracellular matrix production, and survival of fibroblasts.

LID - 10.1186/1750-1172-7-79 [doi]
AB  - Diffuse parenchymal lung diseases (DPLD) represent a diverse group of disorders 
      affecting the distal lung parenchyma, specifically the tissue and spaces 
      surrounding the alveoli, which may be filled with inflammatory cells, 
      proliferating fibroblasts or established fibrosis, often leading to architectural 
      distortion and impaired gas exchange. While the underlying pathogenetic 
      mechanisms are known or inferred for some DPLD (such as sarcoidosis, silicosis, 
      drug reactions and collagen vascular diseases), the pathogenesis of the majority 
      of these entities - particularly those characterized by progressive fibrosis - is 
      poorly understood.Several lines of evidence indicate that the development of 
      pulmonary fibrosis is genetically determined. They include: 1. familial 
      clustering; 2. the occurrence of pulmonary fibrosis in the context of rare 
      inherited disorders; 3. substantial variability in the development of pulmonary 
      fibrosis amongst individuals exposed to organic or inorganic dusts; 4. difference 
      in susceptibility to fibrogenic stimuli amongst inbred strains of mice.This 
      review focuses on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and sarcoidosis, the two 
      most common DPLD and the two entities for which there is stronger evidence of a 
      genetic predisposition, although how aberrant genes interact with each other and 
      with environmental factors, such as smoking in IPF and infectious agents in 
      sarcoidosis, in determining disease susceptibility and clinical phenotypes is 
      largely unknown. Finally, we discuss practical issues and implications for both 
      patients and physicians of recent advances in the genetics of sarcoidosis and 
      IPF.

AB  - Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a class of bioactive lyso-phospholipid that 
      mediates most of its biological effects through a family of G protein-coupled 
      receptors of which six have been identified. The role of the LPA pathway in 
      driving chronic lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has 
      gained considerable academic and industry attention. Modulation of the pulmonary 
      artery endothelial barrier function by the LPA1 receptor has been shown to drive 
      pulmonary fibrosis in murine models of disease. The purpose of this study was (i) 
      to assess the effect of LPA on the barrier function of human pulmonary arterial 
      (HPAEC) and microvascular (HMVEC) endothelial cells and (ii) to identify the LPA 
      receptor subtype(s) responsible for changes in human pulmonary endothelial cell 
      permeability using LPA receptor antagonists and siRNA technology. Analysis of the 
      LPA receptor subtype expression demonstrated predominant expression of LPA2 and 
      LPA6 receptor subtypes in both HPAECs and HMVECs. HPAECs also exhibit low 
      expression of LPA1, LPA3, and LPA4 receptor subtypes. Treatment of cells with 
      increasing concentrations of LPA caused loss of barrier function in HPAECs but 
      not HMVECs, despite both cell types exhibiting very similar LPA receptor 
      expression profiles. The LPA-mediated loss of barrier function in HPAECs appears 
      to be independent of the LPA1 receptor and likely to be mediated via the LPA6 
      receptor although we cannot exclude an additional role for the LPA2 and LPA4 
      receptors in mediating these effects. These results suggest cell-specific 
      mechanisms exist in human pulmonary endothelial cells to permit regulation of 
      barrier function downstream of LPA receptors. More importantly, our data indicate 
      that selective LPA1 receptor antagonism may be insufficient for therapeutic use 
      in pulmonary diseases where impaired endothelial barrier function is related to 
      disease initiation and progression.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate protein expression in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) 
      obtained from West Highland White Terriers with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
      (IPF), dogs with chronic bronchitis, and healthy control dogs to identify 
      potential biomarkers for IPF. SAMPLES: BALF samples obtained from 6 West Highland 
      White Terriers with histologically confirmed IPF, 5 dogs with chronic bronchitis, 
      and 4 healthy Beagles. PROCEDURES: Equal amounts of proteins in concentrated BALF 
      samples were separated via 2-D differential gel electrophoresis. Proteins that 
      were differentially expressed relative to results for healthy control dogs were 
      identified with mass spectrometry and further verified via western blotting. 
      RESULTS: Expression of 6 proteins was upregulated and that of 1 protein was 
      downregulated in dogs with IPF or chronic bronchitis, compared with results for 
      healthy dogs. Expression of proteins beta-actin, complement C3, alpha-1-antitrypsin, 
      apolipoprotein A-1, haptoglobin, and transketolase was upregulated, whereas 
      expression of lysozyme C was downregulated. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: 
      Proteomics can be used to search for biomarkers and to reveal disease-specific 
      mechanisms. The quantitative comparison of proteomes for BALF obtained from dogs 
      with IPF and chronic bronchitis and healthy dogs revealed similar changes for the 
      dogs with IPF and chronic bronchitis, which suggested a common response to 
      disease processes in otherwise different lung diseases. Specific biomarkers for 
      IPF were not identified.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has been associated with abnormal 
      vascular remodeling. Bone marrow derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are 
      considered to possess lung tissue repair and vascular remodeling properties. 
      OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to assess early EPCs levels and EPCs endogenous 
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in IPF. In order to examine 
      alterations in the mobilization of EPCs from the bone marrow we measured plasma 
      VEGF. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-three patients with IPF and fifteen healthy subjects 
      were included. The number of early EPCs colonies was markedly reduced in IPF 
      patients vs controls (6.00+/-6.49 vs 49.68+/-16.73, respectively, p<0.001). EPCs were 
      further decreased in patients presenting systolic pulmonary arterial pressure 
      (sPAP)>/=35 mmHg. The number of colonies per well correlated negatively with 
      P((A-a))O(2) (r =  -0.750, p<0.001). Additionally, VEGF mRNA levels were 
      significantly increased in IPF patients. There were no differences observed in 
      VEGF plasma levels in IPF patients when compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      current data suggest that inadequate levels of early EPCs may potentially 
      contribute to suppressed repair and recovery of the damaged pulmonary endothelium 
      and thereby may drive the sequence of events in profibrogenic direction. 
      Increased VEGFmRNA levels in the clinical context of IPF may represent a 
      compensatory mechanism to overcome reduced EPCs levels.

AB  - Matrix stiffening and myofibroblast resistance to apoptosis are cardinal features 
      of chronic fibrotic diseases involving diverse organ systems. The interactions 
      between altered tissue biomechanics and cellular signaling that sustain 
      progressive fibrosis are not well defined. In this study, we used ex vivo and in 
      vivo approaches to define a mechanotransduction pathway involving Rho/Rho kinase 
      (Rho/ROCK), actin cytoskeletal remodeling, and a mechanosensitive transcription 
      factor, megakaryoblastic leukemia 1 (MKL1), that coordinately regulate 
      myofibroblast differentiation and survival. Both in an experimental mouse model 
      of lung fibrosis and in human subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), 
      we observed activation of the Rho/ROCK pathway, enhanced actin cytoskeletal 
      polymerization, and MKL1 cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling. Pharmacologic disruption 
      of this mechanotransduction pathway with the ROCK inhibitor fasudil induced 
      myofibroblast apoptosis through a mechanism involving downregulation of BCL-2 and 
      activation of the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Treatment with 
      fasudil during the postinflammatory fibrotic phase of lung injury or genetic 
      ablation of Mkl1 protected mice from experimental lung fibrosis. These studies 
      indicate that targeting mechanosensitive signaling in myofibroblasts to trigger 
      the intrinsic apoptosis pathway may be an effective approach for treatment of 
      fibrotic disorders.

AB  - As miRNAs are associated with normal cellular processes, deregulation of miRNAs 
      is thought to play a causative role in many complex diseases. Nevertheless, the 
      precise contribution of miRNAs in fibrotic lung diseases, especially the 
      idiopathic form (IPF), remains poorly understood. Given the poor response rate of 
      IPF patients to current therapy, new insights into the pathogenic mechanisms 
      controlling lung fibroblasts activation, the key cell type driving the fibrogenic 
      process, are essential to develop new therapeutic strategies for this devastating 
      disease. To identify miRNAs with potential roles in lung fibrogenesis, we 
      performed a genome-wide assessment of miRNA expression in lungs from two 
      different mouse strains known for their distinct susceptibility to develop lung 
      fibrosis after bleomycin exposure. This led to the identification of miR-199a-5p 
      as the best miRNA candidate associated with bleomycin response. Importantly, 
      miR-199a-5p pulmonary expression was also significantly increased in IPF patients 
      (94 IPF versus 83 controls). In particular, levels of miR-199a-5p were 
      selectively increased in myofibroblasts from injured mouse lungs and fibroblastic 
      foci, a histologic feature associated with IPF. Therefore, miR-199a-5p 
      profibrotic effects were further investigated in cultured lung fibroblasts: 
      miR-199a-5p expression was induced upon TGFbeta exposure, and ectopic expression of 
      miR-199a-5p was sufficient to promote the pathogenic activation of pulmonary 
      fibroblasts including proliferation, migration, invasion, and differentiation 
      into myofibroblasts. In addition, we demonstrated that miR-199a-5p is a key 
      effector of TGFbeta signaling in lung fibroblasts by regulating CAV1, a critical 
      mediator of pulmonary fibrosis. Remarkably, aberrant expression of miR-199a-5p 
      was also found in unilateral ureteral obstruction mouse model of kidney fibrosis, 
      as well as in both bile duct ligation and CCl4-induced mouse models of liver 
      fibrosis, suggesting that dysregulation of miR-199a-5p represents a general 
      mechanism contributing to the fibrotic process. MiR-199a-5p thus behaves as a 
      major regulator of tissue fibrosis with therapeutic potency to treat 
      fibroproliferative diseases.

AB  - The accumulation of apoptosis-resistant fibroblasts within fibroblastic foci is a 
      characteristic feature of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), but the mechanisms 
      underlying apoptosis resistance remain unclear. A role for the inhibitor of 
      apoptosis (IAP) protein family member X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) has 
      been suggested by prior studies showing that (1) XIAP is localized to 
      fibroblastic foci in IPF tissue and (2) prostaglandin E(2) suppresses XIAP 
      expression while increasing fibroblast susceptibility to apoptosis. Based on 
      these observations, we hypothesized that XIAP would be regulated by the 
      profibrotic mediators transforming growth factor (TGF)beta-1 and endothelin (ET)-1 
      and that increased XIAP would contribute to apoptosis resistance in IPF 
      fibroblasts. To address these hypotheses, we examined XIAP expression in normal 
      and IPF fibroblasts at baseline and in normal fibroblasts after treatment with 
      TGF-beta1 or ET-1. The role of XIAP in the regulation of fibroblast susceptibility 
      to Fas-mediated apoptosis was examined using functional XIAP antagonists and 
      siRNA silencing. In concordance with prior reports, fibroblasts from IPF lung 
      tissue had increased resistance to apoptosis compared with normal lung 
      fibroblasts. Compared with normal fibroblasts, IPF fibroblasts had significantly 
      but heterogeneously increased basal XIAP expression. Additionally, TGF-beta1 and 
      ET-1 induced XIAP protein expression in normal fibroblasts. Inhibition or 
      silencing of XIAP enhanced the sensitivity of lung fibroblasts to Fas-mediated 
      apoptosis without causing apoptosis in the absence of Fas activation. 
      Collectively, these findings support a mechanistic role for XIAP in the 
      apoptosis-resistant phenotype of IPF fibroblasts.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal lung disease of unknown etiology. 
      It is characterized by alterations of the alveolar epithelium, myofibroblast 
      activation, and increased extracellular matrix deposition. Recently, reactivation 
      of the developmental WNT/beta-catenin pathway has been linked with pulmonary 
      fibrosis. The cell-specific mechanisms and mediators of WNT/beta-catenin signaling 
      in the lung, however, remain elusive. Here, we applied an unbiased gene 
      expression screen to identify epithelial cell-specific mediators of WNT/beta-catenin 
      signaling. We found the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1beta to be one of the most 
      up-regulated genes in primary murine alveolar epithelial Type II (ATII) cells 
      after WNT3a treatment. Increased transcript and protein expression of IL-1beta upon 
      WNT3a treatment was further detected in primary ATII cells by quantitative RT-PCR 
      (log fold change, 2.0 +/- 0.5) and ELISA (1.8-fold increase). We observed 
      significant up-regulation of IL-1beta and IL-6 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 
      (BALF) in bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in vivo. Importantly, primary fibrotic 
      ATII cells isolated from lungs subjected to bleomycin secreted enhanced IL-1beta and 
      IL-6 in vitro. Furthermore, the orotracheal application of recombinant WNT 
      protein in the Tcf optimal promoter (TOP)-beta-galactosidase reporter animals led to 
      WNT/beta-catenin activation in epithelial cells, along with significant increases in 
      IL-1beta and IL-6 in vivo (2.7-fold and 6.0-fold increases, respectively). Finally, 
      we found increased WNT3a protein in fibrotic alveolar epithelia, accompanied by 
      enhanced IL-1beta and IL-6 concentrations in BALF from patients with IPF. Taken 
      together, our findings reveal that the alveolar epithelium is a relevant source 
      of proinflammatory cytokines induced by active WNT/beta-catenin in pulmonary 
      fibrosis. Thus, WNT/interleukin signaling represents a novel link between 
      developmental pathway reactivation and inflammation in the development of 
      pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - The preclinical model of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, used to investigate 
      mechanisms related to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), has incorrectly 
      predicted efficacy for several candidate compounds suggesting that it may be of 
      limited value. As an attempt to improve the predictive nature of this model, 
      integrative bioinformatic approaches were used to compare molecular alterations 
      in the lungs of bleomycin-treated mice and patients with IPF. Using gene set 
      enrichment analysis we show for the first time that genes differentially 
      expressed during the fibrotic phase of the single challenge bleomycin model were 
      significantly enriched in the expression profiles of IPF patients. The genes that 
      contributed most to the enrichment were largely involved in mitosis, growth 
      factor, and matrix signaling. Interestingly, these same mitotic processes were 
      increased in the expression profiles of fibroblasts isolated from rapidly 
      progressing, but not slowly progressing, IPF patients relative to control 
      subjects. The data also indicated that TGFbeta was not the sole mediator responsible 
      for the changes observed in this model since the ALK-5 inhibitor SB525334 
      effectively attenuated some but not all of the fibrosis associated with this 
      model. Although some would suggest that repetitive bleomycin injuries may more 
      effectively model IPF-like changes, our data do not support this conclusion. 
      Together, these data highlight that a single bleomycin instillation effectively 
      replicates several of the specific pathogenic molecular changes associated with 
      IPF, and may be best used as a model for patients with active disease.

TI  - FoxO3a (Forkhead Box O3a) deficiency protects Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) 
      fibroblasts from type I polymerized collagen matrix-induced apoptosis via 
      caveolin-1 (cav-1) and Fas.

AB  - Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis is a lethal fibrotic disease characterized by the 
      unrelenting proliferation and persistence of fibroblasts in a type I 
      collagen-rich matrix that result in an expanding reticular network of fibrotic 
      tissue. However, the underlying mechanism responsible for the persistence of 
      myofibroblasts in IPF remains unclear. During normal tissue repair, unwanted 
      fibroblasts are eliminated during collagen-matrix contraction by a mechanism 
      whereby high PTEN activity suppresses Akt. We have previously found that FoxO3a, 
      a transcriptional activator of apoptosis-inducing proteins, is inactivated in IPF 
      fibroblasts resulting from aberrantly high PI3K/Akt activity due to 
      inappropriately low PTEN activity. Here we demonstrate that this low FoxO3a 
      activity confers IPF fibroblasts with resistance to collagen-mediated apoptosis. 
      We show that the mechanism by which low FoxO3a activity confers IPF fibroblasts 
      with an apoptotic resistant phenotype involves suppression of Fas expression as a 
      result of down regulation of cav-1 expression via a PTEN/Akt-dependent pathway. 
      We demonstrate that PTEN over-expression or Akt inhibition increases FoxO3a 
      expression in IPF fibroblasts, resulting in up-regulation of caveolin-1. We show 
      that FoxO3a binds to the cav-1 promoter region and ectopic expression of FoxO3a 
      transcriptionally increases cav-1 mRNA and protein expression. In turn, we show 
      that overexpression of caveolin-1 increases Fas levels and caspase-3/7 activity 
      and promotes IPF fibroblast apoptosis on polymerized type I collagen. We have 
      found that the expression of caveolin-1, Fas and cleaved caspase-3 proteins in 
      fibroblasts within the fibroblastic foci of IPF patient specimens is low. Our 
      data indicate that the pathologically altered PTEN/Akt axis inactivates FoxO3a 
      down-regulating cav-1 and Fas expression. This confers IPF fibroblasts with an 
      apoptosis-resistant phenotype and may be responsible for IPF progression.

AB  - Chemokine (CC motif) ligand-2 (CCL2) is a member of C-C chemokine superfamily 
      that contributes to inflammatory and fibrotic process. Studies in patients and 
      experimental animals provide compelling evidence that increased CCL2 expression 
      plays an important role in the development of fibroproliferative lung disease. 
      The up-regulated CCL2 expression in pulmonary fibrosis is also involved in the 
      potent profibrotic effects that thrombin exerts during lung injury. Here, we 
      investigated the transcriptional mechanism involved in CCL2 production by 
      thrombin in human primary lung fibroblasts and explored the transcriptional 
      mechanism of increased CCL2 expression in pulmonary fibrosis. Thrombin increased 
      CCL2 mRNA levels but not mRNA stability, suggesting it was acting 
      transcriptionally. The increased binding of transcription factors to nuclear 
      factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) elements in the CCL2 promoter 
      contributed to active transcription following thrombin stimulation. Primary human 
      lung fibroblasts isolated from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) 
      produced significantly higher levels of CCL2 than nonfibrotic lung fibroblasts. 
      Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays detected increased binding of 
      NF-kappaB p65 and AP-1 subunit c-Jun to the CCL2 promoter of IPF cells both in the 
      presence and absence of thrombin stimulation. The significantly increased binding 
      of p65 and c-Jun to the CCL2 promoter was also observed in the lung tissue of 
      bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis murine model. Collectively, these findings 
      strongly suggest that the increased binding of transcription factors to NF-kappaB and 
      AP-1 elements in the CCL2 promoter is responsible for the active transcription 
      expression of CCL2 in pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - Fibrosis underlies the pathogenesis of numerous diseases and leads to severe 
      damage of vital body organs and, frequently, to death. Better understanding of 
      the mechanisms resulting in fibrosis is essential for developing appropriate 
      treatment solutions and is therefore of upmost importance. Recent evidence 
      suggests a significant antifibrotic potential of an integral membrane protein, 
      caveolin-1. While caveolin-1 has been widely studied for its role in the 
      regulation of cell signaling and endocytosis, its possible implication in 
      fibrosis remains largely unclear. In this review we survey involvement of 
      caveolin-1 in various cellular processes and highlight different aspects of its 
      antifibrotic activity. We hypothesize that caveolin-1 conveys a homeostatic 
      function in the process of fibrosis by (a) regulating TGF-beta1 and its downstream 
      signaling; (b) regulating critical cellular processes involved in tissue repair, 
      such as migration, adhesion and cellular response to mechanical stress; and (c) 
      antagonizing profibrotic processes, such as proliferation. Finally, we consider 
      this homeostatic function of caveolin-1 as a possible novel approach in treatment 
      of fibroproliferative diseases.

AB  - Although the recruitment of fibroblasts to areas of injury is critical for wound 
      healing, their subsequent apoptosis is necessary in order to prevent excessive 
      scarring. Fibroproliferative diseases, such as pulmonary fibrosis, are often 
      characterized by fibroblast resistance to apoptosis, but the mechanism(s) for 
      this resistance remains elusive. Here, we employed a murine model of pulmonary 
      fibrosis and cells from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) to 
      explore epigenetic mechanisms that may be responsible for the decreased 
      expression of Fas, a cell surface death receptor whose expression has been 
      observed to be decreased in pulmonary fibrosis. Murine pulmonary fibrosis was 
      elicited by intratracheal injection of bleomycin. Fibroblasts cultured from 
      bleomycin-treated mice exhibited decreased Fas expression and resistance to 
      Fas-mediated apoptosis compared with cells from saline-treated control mice. 
      Although there were no differences in DNA methylation, the Fas promoter in 
      fibroblasts from bleomycin-treated mice exhibited decreased histone acetylation 
      and increased histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9Me3). This was associated 
      with increased histone deacetylase (HDAC)-2 and HDAC4 expression. Treatment with 
      HDAC inhibitors increased Fas expression and restored susceptibility to 
      Fas-mediated apoptosis. Fibroblasts from patients with IPF likewise exhibited 
      decreased histone acetylation and increased H3K9Me3 at the Fas promoter and 
      increased their expression of Fas in the presence of an HDAC inhibitor. These 
      findings demonstrate the critical role of histone modifications in the 
      development of fibroblast resistance to apoptosis in both a murine model and in 
      patients with pulmonary fibrosis and suggest novel approaches to therapy for 
      progressive fibroproliferative disorders.

TI  - Association between the MUC5B promoter polymorphism and survival in patients with 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 2232-9
LID - 10.1001/jama.2013.5827 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Current prediction models of mortality in idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF), which are based on clinical and physiological parameters, have 
      modest value in predicting which patients will progress. In addition to the 
      potential for improving prognostic models, identifying genetic and molecular 
      features that are associated with IPF mortality may provide insight into the 
      underlying mechanisms of disease and inform clinical trials. OBJECTIVE: To 
      determine whether the MUC5B promoter polymorphism (rs35705950), previously 
      reported to be associated with the development of pulmonary fibrosis, is 
      associated with survival in IPF. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective 
      study of survival in 2 independent cohorts of patients with IPF: the INSPIRE 
      cohort, consisting of patients enrolled in the interferon-gamma1b trial (n = 438; 
      December 15, 2003-May 2, 2009; 81 centers in 7 European countries, the United 
      States, and Canada), and the Chicago cohort, consisting of IPF participants 
      recruited from the Interstitial Lung Disease Clinic at the University of Chicago 
      (n = 148; 2007-2010). The INSPIRE cohort was used to model the association of the 
      MUC5B genotype with survival, accounting for the effect of matrix 
      metalloproteinase 7 (MMP-7) blood concentration and other demographic and 
      clinical covariates. The Chicago cohort was used for replication of findings. 
      MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was all-cause mortality. 
      RESULTS: The numbers of patients in the GG, GT, and TT genotype groups were 148 
      (34%), 259 (59%), and 31 (7%), respectively, in the INSPIRE cohort and 41 (28%), 
      98 (66%), and 9 (6%), respectively, in the Chicago cohort. The median follow-up 
      period was 1.6 years for INSPIRE and 2.1 years for Chicago. During follow-up, 
      there were 73 deaths (36 GG, 35 GT, and 2 TT) among INSPIRE patients and 64 
      deaths (26 GG, 36 GT, and 2 TT) among Chicago patients. The unadjusted 2-year 
      cumulative incidence of death was lower among patients carrying 1 or more copies 
      of the IPF risk allele (T) in both the INSPIRE cohort (0.25 [95% CI, 0.17-0.32] 
      for GG, 0.17 [95% CI, 0.11-0.23] for GT, and 0.03 [95% CI, 0.00-0.09] for TT) and 
      the Chicago cohort (0.50 [95% CI, 0.31-0.63] for GG, 0.22 [95% CI, 0.13-0.31] for 
      GT, and 0.11 [95% CI, 0.00-0.28] for TT). In the INSPIRE cohort, the TT and GT 
      genotypes (risk for IPF) were associated with improved survival compared with GG 
      (hazard ratios, 0.23 [95% CI, 0.10-0.52] and 0.48 [95% CI, 0.31-0.72], 
      respectively; P < .001). This finding was replicated in the Chicago cohort 
      (hazard ratios, 0.15 [95% CI, 0.05-0.49] and 0.39 [95% CI, 0.21-0.70], 
      respectively; P < .002). The observed association of MUC5B with survival was 
      independent of age, sex, forced vital capacity, diffusing capacity of carbon 
      monoxide, MMP-7, and treatment status. The addition of the MUC5B genotype to the 
      survival models significantly improved the predictive accuracy of the model in 
      both the INSPIRE cohort (C = 0.71 [95% CI, 0.64-0.75] vs C = 0.68 [95% CI, 
      0.61-0.73]; P < .001) and the Chicago cohort (C = 0.73 [95% CI, 0.62-0.78] vs C = 
      0.69 [95% CI, 0.59-0.75]; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients 
      with IPF, a common risk polymorphism in MUC5B was significantly associated with 
      improved survival. Further research is necessary to refine the risk estimates and 
      to determine the clinical implications of these findings.

AB  - Extravascular activation of the coagulation cascade in the lung is commonly 
      observed in pulmonary fibrosis. Coagulation proteases may exert profibrotic 
      cellular effects via protease-activated receptors (PARs)-1 and -2. Here, we 
      investigated the potential role of two other members of the PAR family, namely 
      PAR-3 and PAR-4, in the pathobiology of lung fibrosis. Elevated expression of 
      PAR-3, but not PAR-4, was detected in the lungs of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
      (IPF) patients and in bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice. Increased PAR-3 
      expression in fibrotic lungs was mainly attributable to alveolar type II (ATII) 
      cells. Stimulation of primary mouse ATII, MLE15 and A549 cells with thrombin 
      (FIIa) - that may activate PAR-1, PAR-3 and PAR-4 - induced 
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that has been suggested to be 
      a possible mechanism underlying the expanded (myo)fibroblast pool in lung 
      fibrosis. EMT was evidenced by morphological alterations, expression changes of 
      epithelial and mesenchymal phenotype markers, and functional changes. Single 
      knockdown of FIIa receptors, PAR-1, PAR-3, or PAR-4, had no major impact on 
      FIIa-induced EMT. Simultaneous depletion of PAR-1 and PAR-3, however, almost 
      completely inhibited this process, whereas only a partial effect on FIIa-mediated 
      EMT was observed when PAR-1 and PAR-4, or PAR-3 and PAR-4 were knocked down. 
      PAR-1 and PAR-3 co-localise within ATII cells with both being predominantely 
      plasma membrane associated. In conclusion, our study indicates that PARs 
      synergise to mediate FIIa-induced EMT and provides first evidence that PAR-3 via 
      its ability to potentiate FIIa-triggered EMT could potentially contribute to the 
      pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - Different anatomic and physiological changes occur in the lung of aging people 
      that can affect pulmonary functions, and different pulmonary diseases, including 
      deadly diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/emphysema 
      and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), can be related to an acceleration of the 
      aging process. The individual genetic background, as well as exposure to a 
      variety of toxic substances (cigarette smoke in primis) can contribute 
      significantly to accelerating pulmonary senescence. Premature aging can impair 
      lung function by different ways: by interfering specifically with tissue repair 
      mechanisms after damage, thus perturbing the correct crosstalk between 
      mesenchymal and epithelial components; by inducing systemic and/or local 
      alteration of the immune system, thus impairing the complex mechanisms of lung 
      defense against infections; and by stimulating a local and/or systemic 
      inflammatory condition (inflammaging). According to recently proposed pathogenic 
      models in COPD and IPF, premature cellular senescence likely affects distinct 
      progenitors cells (mesenchymal stem cells in COPD, alveolar epithelial precursors 
      in IPF), leading to stem cell exhaustion. In this review, the large amount of 
      data supporting this pathogenic view are discussed, with emphasis on the possible 
      molecular and cellular mechanisms leading to the severe parenchymal remodeling 
      that characterizes, in different ways, these deadly diseases.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an interstitial lung disease of unknown 
      cause that lacks a proven therapy for altering its high mortality rate. 
      Microarrays have been employed to investigate the pathogenesis of IPF, but are 
      presented mostly at the gene-expression level due to technologic limitations. In 
      as much as, alternative RNA splicing isoforms are increasingly identified as 
      potential regulators of human diseases, including IPF, we propose a new approach 
      with the capacity to detect splicing variants using RNA-seq data. We conducted a 
      joint analysis of differential expression and differential splicing on annotated 
      human genes and isoforms, and identified 122 non-differentially expressed genes 
      with a high degree of "switch" between major and minor isoforms. Three cases with 
      variant mechanisms for alternative splicing were validated using qRT-PCR, among 
      the group of genes in which expression was not significantly changed at the gene 
      level. We also identified 35 novel transcripts that were unique to the fibrotic 
      lungs using exon-exon junction evidence, and selected a representative for 
      qRT-PCR validation. The results of our study are likely to provide new insight 
      into the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis and may eventuate in new treatment 
      targets.

AB  - Oxidant-mediated death of lung epithelial cells due to cigarette smoking plays an 
      important role in pathogenesis in lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF). However, the exact mechanism by which oxidants induce epithelial 
      cell death is not fully understood. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) modulator 1 
      (Romo1) is localized in the mitochondria and mediates mitochondrial ROS 
      production through complex III of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. 
      Here, we show that Romo1 mediates mitochondrial ROS production and apoptosis 
      induced by oxidative stress in lung epithelial cells. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) 
      treatment increased Romo1 expression, and Romo1 knockdown suppressed the cellular 
      ROS levels and cell death triggered by H2O2 treatment. In immunohistochemical 
      staining of lung tissues from patients with IPF, Romo1 was mainly localized in 
      hyperplastic alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells. Romo1 overexpression was 
      detected in 14 of 18 patients with IPF. TUNEL-positive alveolar epithelial cells 
      were also detected in most patients with IPF but not in normal controls. These 
      findings suggest that Romo1 mediates apoptosis induced by oxidative stress in 
      lung epithelial cells.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, 
      invariably fatal condition with a median survival from diagnosis of only 3 years. 
      Despite improvements in disease understanding, challenges remain in establishing 
      a diagnosis and predicting prognosis in individual patients. Furthermore, limited 
      understanding of the key pathogenetic mechanisms driving disease is hampering 
      development of new therapies. This review outlines progress that has been made in 
      applying systems biology to IPF and the insights into disease pathogenesis, 
      diagnosis and monitoring that this research is providing. RECENT FINDINGS: 
      Large-scale genome-wide association studies have highlighted polymorphisms in 
      genes involved in epithelial integrity and host defense including MUC5B and 
      TOLLIP. Whole blood transcriptomics points towards changes in immune cell 
      regulation that influence the progression of fibrosis. Proteomic studies have 
      identified serum proteins, including matrix metalloproteinase 7 and CC chemokine 
      ligand (CCL)-18, which associate with disease severity and predict prognosis. 
      SUMMARY: Use of molecular research techniques in large populations of 
      well-phenotyped patients is leading to major advances in understanding of IPF. As 
      new treatments for IPF emerge, it is to be hoped that careful application of 
      these findings will enable the targeting of therapy to individuals based on the 
      predominant mechanisms driving progression of their disease.

AB  - The pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remains largely unknown. 
      It is believed that IPF is mainly driven by activated alveolar epithelial cells 
      that have a compromised migration capacity, and that also produce substances 
      (such as connective tissue growth factor, CTGF) that contribute to fibroblast 
      activation and matrix protein accumulation. Because the mechanisms regulating 
      these processes are unclear, the aim of this study was to determine the role of 
      rapamycin in regulating epithelial cell migration and CTGF expression. 
      Transformed epithelial cell line A549 and normal human pulmonary alveolar or 
      bronchial epithelial cells were cultured in regular medium or medium containing 
      rapamycin. Real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was employed 
      to determine CTGF mRNA expression. Western blotting and an enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay were used for detecting CTGF protein. Wound healing and 
      migration assays were used to determine the cell migration potential. 
      Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta type I receptor (TbetaRI) inhibitor, SB431542 and 
      phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, LY294002 were used to determine 
      rapamycin's mechanism of action. It was found that treatment of A549 and normal 
      human alveolar or bronchial epithelial cells with rapamycin significantly 
      promoted basal or TGF-beta1 induced CTGF expression. LY294002, not SB431542 
      attenuated the promotional effect of rapamycin on CTGF expression. Cell mobility 
      was not affected by rapamycin in wound healing and migration assays. These data 
      suggest rapamycin has a profibrotic effect in vitro and underscore the potential 
      of combined therapeutic approach with PI3K and mammalian target of rapamycin 
      inhibitors for the treatment of animal or human lung fibrosis.

PG  - e74220

LID - e74220
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis infection, disease and mortality are all less common at 
      high than low altitude and ascent to high altitude was historically recommended 
      for treatment. The immunological and mycobacterial mechanisms underlying the 
      association between altitude and tuberculosis are unclear. We studied the effects 
      of altitude on mycobacteria and antimycobacterial immunity. METHODS: 
      Antimycobacterial immunity was assayed in 15 healthy adults residing at low 
      altitude before and after they ascended to 3400 meters; and in 47 long-term 
      high-altitude residents. Antimycobacterial immunity was assessed as the extent to 
      which participants' whole blood supported or restricted growth of genetically 
      modified luminescent Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) mycobacteria during 96 hours 
      incubation. We developed a simplified whole blood assay that could be used by a 
      technician in a low-technology setting. We used this to compare mycobacterial 
      growth in participants' whole blood versus positive-control culture broth and 
      versus negative-control plasma. RESULTS: Measurements of mycobacterial 
      luminescence predicted the number of mycobacterial colonies cultured six weeks 
      later. At low altitude, mycobacteria grew in blood at similar rates to 
      positive-control culture broth whereas ascent to high altitude was associated 
      with restriction (p </= 0.002) of mycobacterial growth to be 4-times less than in 
      culture broth. At low altitude, mycobacteria grew in blood 25-times more than 
      negative-control plasma whereas ascent to high altitude was associated with 
      restriction (p </= 0.01) of mycobacterial growth to be only 6-times more than in 
      plasma. There was no evidence of differences in antimycobacterial immunity at 
      high altitude between people who had recently ascended to high altitude versus 
      long-term high-altitude residents. CONCLUSIONS: An assay of luminescent 
      mycobacterial growth in whole blood was adapted and found to be feasible in 
      low-resource settings. This demonstrated that ascent to or residence at high 
      altitude was associated with decreased mycobacterial growth in whole blood 
      relative to controls, consistent with altitude-related augmentation of 
      antimycobacterial cellular immunity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a serious and 
      progressive form of lung disease, and millions of people suffer from this disease 
      in the world. To provide clues for getting a better understanding of the 
      mechanism of this disease, we identified and further analyzed the differential 
      expressed genes in IPF. METHOD: In this study, we downloaded the gene expression 
      microarray (GSE10667) from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The dataset 
      contained a total of 23 samples, including 15 normal controls and 8 diseases 
      samples (IPF). Then, we identified the differentially expressed genes between 
      normal and disease samples with packages in R language. Consequently, the PPI 
      network was also constructed for the products of these DEGs, and modules in the 
      network were analyzed by Cytoscape's plug-in Mcode and Bingo. Furthermore, 
      enrichment analysis was performed by DAVID to illustrate the altered pathways in 
      IPF. The drug compounds for PLK1 were screened in DrugBank. RESULTS: Atotal of 
      349 genes were identified as differentially expressed genes between normal and 
      disease samples, and we constructed a protein-protein interaction network which 
      included 200 pairs of proteins. Then three modules were identified in our 
      network. Function of these modules were predicted to be related to protein kinase 
      binding, extracellular matrix structural and structural constituent of 
      cytoskeleton, respectively. Finally, we focused on module A including 18 DEGs. 
      CONCLUSIONS: PLK1 (Polo like kinge-1) in this module was predicted as a marker 
      gene in IPF, which was related to cell cycle pathway. Several compounds were 
      found which may be the potential drug for IPF.

PG  - 175-83
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and lethal lung disease 
      characterized by the proliferation of fibroblasts and deposition of extracellular 
      matrix. Since the prognosis of IPF is still poor, novel therapeutic modalities 
      are strongly required. For this reason, to find molecular target for therapy of 
      IPF is of much importance. The recent understanding of pathogenesis in IPF 
      indicates the critical role of alveolar epithelial type II cells (AECII) and 
      fibroblasts. Although the detailed mechanisms involved in IPF is still unclear, 
      various profibrotic mediators which are produced by the injured AECII are thought 
      to play a role in the progression of pulmonary fibrosis via stimulating 
      fibroblasts. Among them, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is one of critical 
      growth factors by stimulating the proliferation and migration of fibroblasts. In 
      this review, we discuss the role of PDGF in pulmonary fibrosis and the 
      possibility as a therapeutic target for IPF.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by abundant collagen production 
      and accumulation of alternatively activated macrophages (M2) in the lower 
      respiratory tract. Mechanisms as to how alveolar macrophages are activated by 
      collagen breakdown products are unknown. Alveolar macrophages were obtained by 
      bronchoalveolar lavage from 30 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) 
      and 37 healthy donors (HD). Alveolar macrophages were cultured in the presence of 
      collagen type I, III, IV and V monomers w/wo a neutralizing antibody against 
      scavenger receptor I class A (CD204). Culture supernatants were assayed for the 
      M2 markers CCL18, CCL2, and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) by ELISA. 
      Furthermore, expression of phospho-Akt was measured using ELISA and expression of 
      CD204 by RT-PCR and flow cytometry. Stimulation with collagen type I and III 
      monomers significantly up-regulated CCL18, IL-1ra production of alveolar 
      macrophages. Furthermore, expression of CCL2 and CD204 were up-regulated by 
      collagen type I exposure. In addition, collagen type I stimulation increased 
      pospho-Akt expression. Collagen type I effects were abrogated by neutralizing 
      antiCD204 and a non-selective Phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase inhibitor 
      (LY294002). Spontaneous CD204 expression of alveolar macrophages was 
      significantly increased in patients with IPF. In conclusion, our findings 
      demonstrate that monomeric collagen type I via CD204 induces phospho-Akt 
      expression shifting alveolar macrophages to the profibrotic M2 type. Innate 
      immune responses induced by collagen monomers might perpetuate pulmonary 
      fibrosis.

TI  - Tumor necrosis factor-alpha accelerates the resolution of established pulmonary 
      fibrosis in mice by targeting profibrotic lung macrophages.
PG  - 825-37

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a relentless, fibrotic parenchymal lung 
      disease in which alternatively programmed macrophages produce profibrotic 
      molecules that promote myofibroblast survival and collagen synthesis. Effective 
      therapies to treat patients with IPF are lacking, and conventional therapy may be 
      harmful. We tested the hypothesis that therapeutic lung delivery of the 
      proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha into wild-type fibrotic 
      mice would reduce the profibrotic milieu and accelerate the resolution of 
      established pulmonary fibrosis. Fibrosis was assessed in bleomycin-instilled 
      wild-type and TNF-alpha(-/-) mice by measuring hydroxyproline levels, static 
      compliance, and Masson's trichrome staining. Macrophage infiltration and 
      programming status was assessed by flow cytometry of enzymatically digested lung 
      and in situ immunostaining. Pulmonary delivery of TNF-alpha to wild-type mice with 
      established pulmonary fibrosis was found to reduce their fibrotic burden, to 
      improve lung function and architecture, and to reduce the number and programming 
      status of profibrotic alternatively programmed macrophages. In contrast, fibrosis 
      and alternative macrophage programming were prolonged in bleomycin-instilled 
      TNF-alpha(-/-) mice. To address the role of the reduced numbers of alternatively 
      programmed macrophages in the TNF-alpha-induced resolution of established pulmonary 
      fibrosis, we conditionally depleted macrophages in MAFIA (MAcrophage Fas-Induced 
      Apoptosis) mice. Conditional macrophage depletion phenocopied the resolution of 
      established pulmonary fibrosis observed after therapeutic TNF-alpha delivery. Taken 
      together, our results show for the first time that TNF-alpha is involved in the 
      resolution of established pulmonary fibrosis via a mechanism involving reduced 
      numbers and programming status of profibrotic macrophages. We speculate that 
      pulmonary delivery of TNF-alpha or augmenting its signaling pathway represent a novel 
      therapeutic strategy to resolve established pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and fatal lung disease 
      characterized by the overgrowth, hardening, and scarring of lung tissue. The 
      exact mechanisms of how IPF develops and progresses are unknown. IPF is 
      characterized by extracellular matrix remodeling and accumulation of active TGFbeta, 
      which promotes collagen expression and the differentiation of smooth muscle 
      alpha-actin (SMA)-positive myofibroblasts. Aortic carboxypeptidase-like protein 
      (ACLP) is an extracellular matrix protein secreted by fibroblasts and 
      myofibroblasts and is expressed in fibrotic human lung tissue and in mice with 
      bleomycin-induced fibrosis. Importantly, ACLP knockout mice are significantly 
      protected from bleomycin-induced fibrosis. The goal of this study was to identify 
      the mechanisms of ACLP action on fibroblast differentiation. As primary lung 
      fibroblasts differentiated into myofibroblasts, ACLP expression preceded SMA and 
      collagen expression. Recombinant ACLP induced SMA and collagen expression in 
      mouse and human lung fibroblasts. Knockdown of ACLP slowed the 
      fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition and partially reverted differentiated 
      myofibroblasts by reducing SMA expression. We hypothesized that ACLP stimulates 
      myofibroblast formation partly through activating TGFbeta signaling. Treatment of 
      fibroblasts with recombinant ACLP induced phosphorylation and nuclear 
      translocation of Smad3. This phosphorylation and induction of SMA was dependent 
      on TGFbeta receptor binding and kinase activity. ACLP-induced collagen expression 
      was independent of interaction with the TGFbeta receptor. These findings indicate 
      that ACLP stimulates the fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition by promoting SMA 
      expression via TGFbeta signaling and promoting collagen expression through a TGFbeta 
      receptor-independent pathway.

AB  - Short telomeres are frequently identified in patients with idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF) and its inherited form, familial interstitial pneumonia (FIP). We 
      identified a kindred with FIP with short telomeres who did not carry a mutation 
      in known FIP genes TERT or hTR . We performed targeted sequencing of other 
      telomere-related genes to identify the genetic basis of FIP in this kindred. The 
      proband was a 69 year-old man with dyspnea, restrictive pulmonary function test 
      results, and reticular changes on high-resolution CT scan. An older male sibling 
      had died from IPF. The proband had markedly shortened telomeres in peripheral 
      blood and undetectably short telomeres in alveolar epithelial cells. Polymerase 
      chain reaction-based sequencing of NOP10 , TINF2 , NHP2 , and DKC1 revealed that 
      both affected siblings shared a novel A to G 1213 transition in DKC1 near the hTR 
      binding domain that is predicted to encode a Thr405Ala amino acid substitution. 
      hTR levels were decreased out of proportion to DKC1 expression in the T405A DKC1 
      proband, suggesting this mutation destabilizes hTR and impairs telomerase 
      function. This DKC1 variant represents the third telomere-related gene identified 
      as a genetic cause of FIP. Further investigation into the mechanism by which 
      dyskerin contributes to the development of lung fibrosis is warranted.

TI  - Thrombin induces ICAM-1 expression in human lung epithelial cells via 
      c-Src/PDGFR/PI3K/Akt-dependent NF-kappaB/p300 activation.
PG  - 171-83
LID - 10.1042/CS20130676 [doi]
AB  - Up-regulation of ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1) is frequently 
      implicated in lung inflammation and lung diseases, such as IPF (idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis). Thrombin has been shown to play a key role in inflammation 
      via the induction of adhesion molecules, which then causes lung injury. However, 
      the mechanisms underlying thrombin-induced ICAM-1 expression in HPAEpiCs (human 
      pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells) remain unclear. In the present study, we 
      have shown that thrombin induced ICAM-1 expression in HPAEpiCs. Pre-treatment 
      with the inhibitor of thrombin [PPACK (D-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone)], c-Src 
      (PP1), PDGFR (platelet-derived growth factor receptor) (AG1296), PI3K 
      (phosohinositide 3-kinase) (LY294002), NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappaB) (Bay11-7082) or 
      p300 (GR343) and transfection with siRNAs of c-Src, PDGFR, Akt, p65 and p300 
      markedly reduced thrombin-induced ICAM-1 expression and monocyte adherence to 
      HPAEpiCs challenged with thrombin. In addition, we established that thrombin 
      stimulated the phosphorylation of c-Src, PDGFR, Akt and p65, which were inhibited 
      by pre-treatment with their respective inhibitors PP1, AG1296, LY294002 or 
      Bay11-7082. In addition, thrombin also enhanced Akt and NF-kappaB translocation from 
      the cytosol to the nucleus, which was reduced by PP1, AG1296 or LY294002. 
      Thrombin induced NF-kappaB promoter activity and the formation of the p65-Akt-p300 
      complex, which were inhibited by AG1296, LY294002 or PP1. Finally, we have shown 
      that thrombin stimulated in vivo binding of p300, Akt and p65 to the ICAM-1 
      promoter, which was reduced by AG1296, LY294002, SH-5 or PP1. These results show 
      that thrombin induced ICAM-1 expression and monocyte adherence via a 
      c-Src/PDGFR/PI3K/Akt/NF-kappaB-dependent pathway in HPAEpiCs. Increased understanding 
      of the signalling mechanisms underlying ICAM-1 gene regulation will create 
      opportunities for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Transforming growth factor-beta1 downregulates vascular endothelial growth factor-D 
      expression in human lung fibroblasts via the Jun NH2-terminal kinase signaling 
      pathway.
PG  - 120-34
LID - 10.2119/molmed.2013.00123 [doi]
AB  - Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-D, a member of the VEGF family, induces 
      both angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis by activating VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) 
      and VEGFR-3 on the surface of endothelial cells. Transforming growth factor 
      (TGF)-beta1 has been shown to stimulate VEGF-A expression in human lung fibroblast 
      via the Smad3 signaling pathway and to induce VEGF-C in human proximal tubular 
      epithelial cells. However, the effects of TGF-beta1 on VEGF-D regulation are 
      unknown. To investigate the regulation of VEGF-D, human lung fibroblasts were 
      studied under pro-fibrotic conditions in vitro and in idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF) lung tissue. We demonstrate that TGF-beta1 downregulates VEGF-D 
      expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner in human lung fibroblasts. This 
      TGF-beta1 effect can be abolished by inhibitors of TGF-beta type I receptor kinase and 
      Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), but not by Smad3 knockdown. In addition, VEGF-D 
      knockdown in human lung fibroblasts induces G1/S transition and promotes cell 
      proliferation. Importantly, VEGF-D protein expression is decreased in lung 
      homogenates from IPF patients compared with control lung. In IPF lung sections, 
      fibroblastic foci show very weak VEGF-D immunoreactivity, whereas VEGF-D is 
      abundantly expressed within alveolar interstitial cells in control lung. Taken 
      together, our data identify a novel mechanism for downstream signal transduction 
      induced by TGF-beta1 in lung fibroblasts, through which they may mediate tissue 
      remodeling in IPF.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive, and high-lethality 
      fibrotic lung disease characterized by excessive fibroblast proliferation, 
      extracellular matrix accumulation, and, ultimately, loss of lung function. 
      Although dysregulation of some microRNAs (miRs) has been shown to play important 
      roles in the pathophysiological processes of IPF, the role of miRs in fibrotic 
      lung diseases is not well understood. In this study, we found downregulation of 
      miR-26a in the lungs of mice with experimental pulmonary fibrosis and in IPF, 
      which resulted in posttranscriptional derepression of connective tissue growth 
      factor (CTGF), and induced collagen production. More importantly, inhibition of 
      miR-26a in the lungs caused pulmonary fibrosis in vivo, whereas overexpression of 
      miR-26a repressed transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1-induced fibrogenesis in 
      MRC-5 cells and attenuated experimental pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Our study 
      showed that miR-26a was downregulated by TGF-beta1-mediated phosphorylation of 
      Smad3. Moreover, miR-26a inhibited the nuclear translocation of p-Smad3 through 
      directly targeting Smad4, which determines the nuclear translocation of 
      p-Smad2/Smad3. Taken together, our experiments demonstrated the antifibrotic 
      effects of miR-26a in fibrotic lung diseases and suggested a new strategy for the 
      prevention and treatment of IPF using miR-26a. The current study also uncovered a 
      novel positive feedback loop between miR-26a and p-Smad3, which is involved in 
      pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - Pirfenidone is an orally active small molecule that has been shown to inhibit the 
      progression of fibrosis in animal models and in patients with idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis. Although pirfenidone exhibits well documented antifibrotic 
      and antiinflammatory activities, in vitro and in vivo, its molecular targets and 
      mechanisms of action have not been elucidated. In this study, we investigated the 
      effects of pirfenidone on proliferation, TGF-beta-induced differentiation and 
      fibrogenic activity of primary human lung fibroblasts (HLFs). Pirfenidone reduced 
      fibroblast proliferation and attenuated TGF-beta-induced alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA) 
      and pro-collagen (Col)-I mRNA and protein levels. Importantly, pirfenidone 
      inhibited TGF-beta-induced phosphorylation of Smad3, p38, and Akt, key factors in 
      the TGF-beta pathway. Together, these results demonstrate that pirfenidone modulates 
      HLF proliferation and TGF-beta-mediated differentiation into myofibroblasts by 
      attenuating key TGF-beta-induced signaling pathways.

TI  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis clustering based on cilium gene expression: 
      profiling a new paradigm.
PG  - 9-15
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), the commonest form of the interstitial lung 
      diseases identifies a specific form of chronic, progressive fibrosing 
      interstitial pneumonia, occurring primarily in older adults, and limited to the 
      lungs. IPF represents an unsolved health problem with an urgent medical need due 
      to lack of effective therapies. Although precise IPF etiology remains elusive, 
      during the past decade there has been a shift away from the pathogenetic theory 
      of generalized inflammation progressing to a paradigm of disordered 
      fibroproliferation and alveolar epithelial cell function. A better understanding 
      of the molecular mechanisms driving IPF fibroblasts proliferation is mandatory to 
      provide insights into the pathogenesis, and to identify highly reproducible 
      biomarkers for disease onset and progression. In this review we aim to discuss 
      and analyze the findings recently published by Yang et al. on Thorax, which 
      reported a strong molecular signature as-sociated with the expression of cilium 
      genes that divides IPF/ usual interstitial pneumonia into two subtypes, one with 
      increased cilium gene expression and one with low expression of cilium genes. The 
      study presents a number of methodology limitations, mainly related to samples 
      characterization and to a general overstatement of the conclusions from class 
      clustering analysis. Nevertheless, the study clearly demonstrates ‑ for the first 
      time ‑ that the cilium apparatus is activated in microscopic honeycombing. In 
      such setting, cilia are likely to act as signaling "machine" which cooperates in 
      promoting proliferative and regenerative cellular processes. Although 
      preliminary, these results sustain a rationale to develop further investigations 
      to confirm the impact of cilium gene expression in IPF with the final perspective 
      of therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is considered one of the pathological 
      mechanisms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Therefore, we examined whether 
      an ER stress regulator, Bax inhibitor-1 (BI-1), regulates collagen accumulation, 
      which is both a marker of fibrosis and a pathological mechanism of fibrosis. The 
      presence of BI-1 inhibited the transforming growth factor-beta1-induced 
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition of epithelial pulmonary cells and 
      bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in a mouse model by enhancing collagen 
      degradation, most likely by enhanced activation of the lysosomal V-ATPase through 
      glycosylation. We also found a correlation between post-translational 
      glycosylation of the V-ATPase and its associated chaperone, calnexin, in 
      BI-1-overexpressing cells. BI-1-induced degradation of collagen through lysosomal 
      V-ATPase glycosylation and the involvement of calnexin were confirmed in a 
      bleomycin-induced fibrosis mouse model. These results highlight the regulatory 
      role of BI-1 in IPF and reveal for the first time the role of lysosomal V-ATPase 
      glycosylation in IPF.

PG  - 1161-72
LID - 10.1164/rccm.201312-2221PP [doi]
AB  - A growing body of evidence indicates that aberrant activation of alveolar 
      epithelial cells and fibroblasts in an aging lung plays a critical role in the 
      pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, the biopathological 
      processes linking aging with IPF and the mechanisms responsible for the abnormal 
      activation of epithelial cells and fibroblasts have not been elucidated. Many of 
      the hallmarks of aging (e.g., genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic 
      alterations, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cellular senescence) have been 
      proposed as essential mechanisms for the development of IPF; however, these 
      disturbances are not restricted to IPF and also occur in other aging-related lung 
      disorders, primarily chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Therefore, an 
      unanswered question is why a current/former smoker of about 60 years of age with 
      shorter telomeres, alveolar epithelial senescence, excessive oxidative stress, 
      and mitochondrial dysfunction develops IPF and not COPD; in other words, what 
      makes old lungs specifically susceptible to develop IPF? In this Perspective, we 
      propose an integral model in which the combination of some gene variants and/or 
      gene expression in the aging lung results in the loss of epithelial integrity and 
      consequently in the failure of the alveoli to correctly respond to injury and to 
      face the stress associated with mechanical stretch. Afterward, a distinctive 
      epigenetic "reprogramming" that affects both epithelial cells and fibroblasts 
      provokes, among others, the recapitulation of developmental pathways and the 
      aberrant activation and miscommunication between both cell types, resulting in 
      the exaggerated production and accumulation of extracellular matrix and the 
      subsequent destruction of the lung architecture.

TI  - Urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) ligation induces a 
      raft-localized integrin signaling switch that mediates the hypermotile phenotype 
      of fibrotic fibroblasts.
PG  - 12791-804
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M113.498576 [doi]
AB  - The urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) is a 
      glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked membrane protein with no cytosolic domain 
      that localizes to lipid raft microdomains. Our laboratory and others have 
      documented that lung fibroblasts from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
      (IPF) exhibit a hypermotile phenotype. This study was undertaken to elucidate the 
      molecular mechanism whereby uPAR ligation with its cognate ligand, urokinase, 
      induces a motile phenotype in human lung fibroblasts. We found that uPAR ligation 
      with the urokinase receptor binding domain (amino-terminal fragment) leads to 
      enhanced migration of fibroblasts on fibronectin in a protease-independent, lipid 
      raft-dependent manner. Ligation of uPAR with the amino-terminal fragment 
      recruited alpha5beta1 integrin and the acylated form of the Src family kinase, Fyn, to 
      lipid rafts. The biological consequences of this translocation were an increase 
      in fibroblast motility and a switch of the integrin-initiated signal pathway for 
      migration away from the lipid raft-independent focal adhesion kinase pathway and 
      toward a lipid raft-dependent caveolin-Fyn-Shc pathway. Furthermore, an integrin 
      homologous peptide as well as an antibody that competes with beta1 for uPAR binding 
      have the ability to block this effect. In addition, its relative insensitivity to 
      cholesterol depletion suggests that the interactions of alpha5beta1 integrin and uPAR 
      drive the translocation of alpha5beta1 integrin-acylated Fyn signaling complexes into 
      lipid rafts upon uPAR ligation through protein-protein interactions. This signal 
      switch is a novel pathway leading to the hypermotile phenotype of IPF 
      patient-derived fibroblasts, seen with uPAR ligation. This uPAR dependent, 
      fibrotic matrix-selective, and profibrotic fibroblast phenotype may be amenable 
      to targeted therapeutics designed to ameliorate IPF.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A polymorphism (rs35705950) in the promoter region of the mucin MUC5B 
      is associated with both familial and sporadic forms of idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis. (IPF) We hypothesize that this common MUC5B variant will impact the 
      expression of cough, a frequent disabling symptom seen in subjects with IPF. 
      METHODS: We genotyped 136 subjects with IPF. All living subjects were provided 
      with a Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) to measure cough severity. We assessed 
      allele effects of the MUC5B polymorphism on the LCQ scores using SAS General 
      Linear Models (GLM) in the patients with IPF. RESULTS: In the 68 of the total 136 
      IPF patients who returned the LCQ, MUC5B minor allele frequency (T) is consistent 
      with prior published studies (31%). We found a significant independent effect of 
      the T allele on the LCQ score (p = 0.002 for subjects with IPF). This effect is 
      independent of other common causes of cough, including gastroesophogeal reflux 
      disease and upper airway cough syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Cough severity, a common 
      disabling phenotypic component of IPF, is significantly associated with the 
      presence of the minor allele of a MUC5B promoter polymorphism. This study 
      highlights a possible genetic mechanism for phenotypic heterogeneity in pulmonary 
      fibrosis.

TI  - Reversal of persistent fibrosis in aging by targeting Nox4-Nrf2 redox imbalance.
PG  - 231ra47
LID - 10.1126/scitranslmed.3008182 [doi]
AB  - The incidence and prevalence of pathological fibrosis increase with advancing 
      age, although mechanisms for this association are unclear. We assessed the 
      capacity for repair of lung injury in young (2 months) and aged (18 months) mice. 
      Whereas the severity of fibrosis was not different between these groups, aged 
      mice demonstrated an impaired capacity for fibrosis resolution. Persistent 
      fibrosis in lungs of aged mice was characterized by the accumulation of senescent 
      and apoptosis-resistant myofibroblasts. These cellular phenotypes were sustained 
      by alterations in cellular redox homeostasis resulting from elevated expression 
      of the reactive oxygen species-generating enzyme Nox4 [NADPH (reduced form of 
      nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) oxidase-4] and an impaired capacity 
      to induce the Nrf2 (NFE2-related factor 2) antioxidant response. Lung tissues 
      from human subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a progressive and 
      fatal lung disease, also demonstrated this Nox4-Nrf2 imbalance. Nox4 mediated 
      senescence and apoptosis resistance in IPF fibroblasts. Genetic and 
      pharmacological targeting of Nox4 in aged mice with established fibrosis 
      attenuated the senescent, antiapoptotic myofibroblast phenotype and led to a 
      reversal of persistent fibrosis. These studies suggest that loss of cellular 
      redox homeostasis promotes profibrotic myofibroblast phenotypes that result in 
      persistent fibrosis associated with aging. Our studies suggest that restoration 
      of Nox4-Nrf2 redox balance in myofibroblasts may be a therapeutic strategy in 
      age-associated fibrotic disorders, potentially able to resolve persistent 
      fibrosis or even reverse its progression.

TI  - Danger-associated molecular patterns and danger signals in idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis.
PG  - 163-8
LID - 10.1165/rcmb.2013-0366TR [doi]
AB  - The chronic debilitating lung disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), is 
      characterized by a progressive decline in lung function, with a median mortality 
      rate of 2-3 years after diagnosis. IPF is a disease of unknown cause and 
      progression, and multiple pathways have been demonstrated to be activated in the 
      lungs of these patients. A recent genome-wide association study of more than 
      1,000 patients with IPF identified genes linked to host defense, cell-cell 
      adhesion, and DNA repair being altered due to fibrosis (Fingerlin, et al. Nat 
      Genet 2013;45:613-620). Further emerging data suggest that the respiratory system 
      may not be a truly sterile environment, and it exhibits an altered microbiome 
      during fibrotic disease (Molyneaux and Maher. Eur Respir Rev 2013;22:376-381). 
      These altered host defense mechanisms might explain the increased susceptibility 
      of patients with IPF to microbial- and viral-induced exacerbations. Moreover, 
      chronic epithelial injury and apoptosis are key features in IPF, which might be 
      mediated, in part, by both pathogen-associated (PA) and danger-associated 
      molecular patterns (MPs). Emerging data indicate that both PAMPs and 
      danger-associated MPs contribute to apoptosis, but not necessarily in a manner 
      that allows for the removal of dying cells, without further exacerbating 
      inflammation. In contrast, both types of MPs drive cellular necrosis, leading to 
      an exacerbation of lung injury and/or infection as the debris promotes a 
      proinflammatory response. Thus, this Review focuses on the impact of MPs 
      resulting from infection-driven apoptosis and necrosis during chronic fibrotic 
      lung disease.

TI  - The mitochondrial cardiolipin remodeling enzyme lysocardiolipin acyltransferase 
      is a novel target in pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 1402-15
LID - 10.1164/rccm.201310-1917OC [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Lysocardiolipin acyltransferase (LYCAT), a cardiolipin-remodeling 
      enzyme regulating the 18:2 linoleic acid pattern of mammalian mitochondrial 
      cardiolipin, is necessary for maintaining normal mitochondrial function and 
      vascular development. We hypothesized that modulation of LYCAT expression in lung 
      epithelium regulates development of pulmonary fibrosis. OBJECTIVES: To define a 
      role for LYCAT in human and murine models of pulmonary fibrosis. METHODS: We 
      analyzed the correlation of LYCAT expression in peripheral blood mononuclear 
      cells (PBMCs) with the outcomes of pulmonary functions and overall survival, and 
      used the murine models to establish the role of LYCAT in fibrogenesis. We studied 
      the LYCAT action on cardiolipin remodeling, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species 
      generation, and apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells under bleomycin challenge. 
      MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: LYCAT expression was significantly altered in 
      PBMCs and lung tissues from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), 
      which was confirmed in two preclinical murine models of IPF, bleomycin- and 
      radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis. LYCAT mRNA expression in PBMCs directly and 
      significantly correlated with carbon monoxide diffusion capacity, pulmonary 
      function outcomes, and overall survival. In both bleomycin- and radiation-induced 
      pulmonary fibrosis murine models, hLYCAT overexpression reduced several indices 
      of lung fibrosis, whereas down-regulation of native LYCAT expression by siRNA 
      accentuated fibrogenesis. In vitro studies demonstrated that LYCAT modulated 
      bleomycin-induced cardiolipin remodeling, mitochondrial membrane potential, 
      reactive oxygen species generation, and apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells, 
      potential mechanisms of LYCAT-mediated lung protection. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      is the first to identify modulation of LYCAT expression in fibrotic lungs and 
      offers a novel therapeutic approach for ameliorating lung inflammation and 
      pulmonary fibrosis.

TI  - Beyond the genome: epigenetic mechanisms in lung remodeling.
PG  - 177-85
LID - 10.1152/physiol.00048.2013 [doi]
AB  - The lung develops from a very simple outpouching of the foregut into a highly 
      complex, finely structured organ with multiple specialized cell types that are 
      required for its normal physiological function. During both the development of 
      the lung and its remodeling in the context of disease or response to injury, gene 
      expression must be activated and silenced in a coordinated manner to achieve the 
      tremendous phenotypic heterogeneity of cell types required for homeostasis and 
      pathogenesis. Epigenetic mechanisms, consisting of DNA base modifications such as 
      methylation, alteration of histones resulting in chromatin modification, and the 
      action of noncoding RNA, control the regulation of information "beyond the 
      genome" required for both lung modeling and remodeling. Epigenetic regulation is 
      subject to modification by environmental stimuli, such as oxidative stress, 
      infection, and aging, and is thus critically important in chronic remodeling 
      disorders such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), chronic obstructive 
      pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and pulmonary 
      hypertension (PH). Technological advances have made it possible to evaluate 
      genome-wide epigenetic changes (epigenomics) in diseases of lung remodeling, 
      clarifying existing pathophysiological paradigms and uncovering novel mechanisms 
      of disease. Many of these represent new therapeutic targets. Advances in 
      epigenomic technology will accelerate our understanding of lung development and 
      remodeling, and lead to novel treatments for chronic lung diseases.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) occurs predominantly in middle-aged and older 
      adults and accounts for 20% to 30% of interstitial lung diseases. It is usually 
      progressive, resulting in respiratory failure and death. Diagnostic criteria for 
      IPF have evolved over the years, and IPF is currently defined as a disease 
      characterized by the histopathologic pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia 
      occurring in the absence of an identifiable cause of lung injury. Understanding 
      of the pathogenesis of IPF has shifted away from chronic inflammation and toward 
      dysregulated fibroproliferative repair in response to alveolar epithelial injury. 
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is likely a heterogeneous disorder caused by 
      various interactions between genetic components and environmental exposures. 
      High-resolution computed tomography can be diagnostic in the presence of typical 
      findings such as bilateral reticular opacities associated with traction 
      bronchiectasis/bronchiolectasis in a predominantly basal and subpleural 
      distribution, along with subpleural honeycombing. In other circumstances, a 
      surgical lung biopsy may be needed. The clinical course of IPF can be 
      unpredictable and may be punctuated by acute deteriorations (acute exacerbation). 
      Although progress continues in unraveling the mechanisms of IPF, effective 
      therapy has remained elusive. Thus, clinicians and patients need to reach 
      informed decisions regarding management options including lung transplant. The 
      findings in this review were based on a literature search of PubMed using the 
      search terms idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and usual interstitial pneumonia, 
      limited to human studies in the English language published from January 1, 2000, 
      through December 31, 2013, and supplemented by key references published before 
      the year 2000.

TI  - Distinct differences in gene expression patterns in pulmonary arteries of 
      patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis with pulmonary hypertension.

AB  - RATIONALE: The development of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in patients with 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
      (COPD) is associated with increased morbidity. OBJECTIVES: To elucidate whether 
      vascular remodeling in a well-characterized PH-COPD and PH-IPF patient cohort 
      results from similar or divergent molecular changes. METHODS: Vascular remodeling 
      of donor, PH-COPD, and PH-IPF pulmonary arteries was assessed. Laser capture 
      microdissected pulmonary artery profiles in combination with whole genome 
      microarrays were performed. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Pulmonary arteries 
      from patients with COPD and IPF with PH exhibited remodeling of vascular layers 
      and reduction of lumen area. Pathway analyses comparing normalized gene 
      expression profiles obtained from patients with PH-IPF or PH-COPD revealed the 
      retinol and extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor interaction to be the most 
      perturbed processes. Within the ECM-receptor pathway, differential regulation of 
      5 out of the top 10 results (collagen, type III, alpha-1; tenascin C; collagen, type 
      VI, alpha-3; thrombospondin 2; and von Willebrand factor) were verified by real-time 
      polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical staining. CONCLUSIONS: Despite 
      clinical and histologic vascular remodeling in all patients with PH-COPD and 
      PH-IPF, differential gene expression pattern was present in pulmonary artery 
      profiles. Several genes involved in retinol metabolism and ECM receptor 
      interaction enable discrimination of vascular remodeling in PH-IPF or PH-COPD. 
      This suggests that pulmonary arterial remodeling in PH-COPD and PH-IPF is caused 
      by different molecular mechanisms and may require specific therapeutic options.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most common and fatal form of 
      idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), short, single-stranded 
      RNAs that regulate protein expression in a post-transcriptional manner, have 
      recently been demonstrated to contribute to IPF pathogenesis. We have previously 
      identified WNT1-inducible signaling pathway protein 1 (WISP1) as a highly 
      expressed pro-fibrotic mediator in IPF, but the underlying mechanisms resulting 
      in increased WISP1 expression, remain elusive. Here, we investigated whether 
      WISP1 is a target of miRNA regulation. We applied a novel supervised machine 
      learning approach, which predicted miR-30a/d and miR-92a target sites in regions 
      of the human WISP1 3'UTR preferentially bound by the miRNA ribonucleoprotein 
      complex. Both miRNAs were decreased in IPF samples, whereas WISP1 protein was 
      increased. We demonstrated further that transforming growth factor 
      (TGF)-beta1-induced WISP1 expression in primary lung fibroblasts in vitro and lung 
      homogenates in vivo. Notably, miR-30a and miR-92a reversed TGF-beta1-induced WISP1 
      mRNA expression in lung fibroblasts. Moreover, miR-92a inhibition increased WISP1 
      protein expression in lung fibroblasts. An inverse relationship for WISP1 and 
      miR-92a was found in a TGF-beta1 dependent lung fibrosis model in vivo. Finally, we 
      found significantly increased WISP1 expression in primary IPF fibroblasts, which 
      negatively correlated with miR-92a level ex vivo. Altogether, our findings 
      indicate a regulatory role of miR-92a for WISP1 expression in pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - The bleomycin-induced rodent lung fibrosis model is commonly used to study 
      mechanisms of lung fibrosis and to test potential therapeutic interventions, 
      despite the well recognized dissimilarities to human idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF). Therefore, in this study, we sought to identify genomic 
      commonalities between the gene expression profiles from 100 IPF lungs and 108 
      control lungs that were obtained from the Lung Tissue Research Consortium, and 
      rat lungs harvested at Days 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, and 56 after bleomycin 
      instillation. Surprisingly, the highest gene expression similarity between 
      bleomycin-treated rat and IPF lungs was observed at Day 7. At this point of 
      maximal rat-human commonality, we identified a novel set of 12 disease-relevant 
      translational gene markers (C6, CTHRC1, CTSE, FHL2, GAL, GREM1, LCN2, MMP7, 
      NELL1, PCSK1, PLA2G2A, and SLC2A5) that was able to separate almost all patients 
      with IPF from control subjects in our cohort and in two additional IPF/control 
      cohorts (GSE10667 and GSE24206). Furthermore, in combination with diffusing 
      capacity of carbon monoxide measurements, four members of the translational gene 
      marker set contributed to stratify patients with IPF according to disease 
      severity. Significantly, pirfenidone attenuated the expression change of one 
      (CTHRC1) translational gene marker in the bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis model, 
      in transforming growth factor-beta1-treated primary human lung fibroblasts and 
      transforming growth factor-beta1-treated human epithelial A549 cells. Our results 
      suggest that a strategy focused on rodent model-human disease commonalities may 
      identify genes that could be used to predict the pharmacological impact of 
      therapeutic interventions, and thus facilitate the development of novel 
      treatments for this devastating lung disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the studies investigating the increased risk of lung cancer 
      in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). DATA SOURCES: Data cited in 
      this review were obtained mainly from PubMed and Medline from 1999 to 2013 and 
      highly regarded older publications were also included. STUDY SELECTION: We 
      identified, retrieved and reviewed the information on the frequency, risk 
      factors, anatomical features, histological types, clinical manifestations, 
      computed tomography findings and underlying mechanisms of lung cancer in IPF 
      patients. RESULTS: The prevalence rates of lung cancer in patients with IPF (4.8% 
      to 48%) are much higher than patients without IPF (2.0% to 6.4%). The risk 
      factors for lung cancer in IPF include smoking, male gender, and age. Lung 
      cancers often occur in the peripheral lung zones where fibrotic changes are 
      predominant. Adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are the most common types 
      of lung cancer in patients with IPF. Radiologic features of these patients 
      include peripherally located, ill-defined mass mimicking air-space disease. The 
      underlying mechanisms of the development of lung cancer in patients with IPF have 
      not been fully understood, but may include the inflammatory response, epithelial 
      injury and/or abnormalities, aberrant fibroblast proliferation, epigenetic and 
      genetic changes, reduced cell-to-cell communication, and activation of specific 
      signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that IPF is associated 
      with increased lung cancer risk. It is necessary to raise the awareness of lung 
      cancer risk in IPF patients among physicians and patients.

AB  - Molecular biomarkers are highly desired in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), 
      where they hold the potential to elucidate underlying disease mechanisms, 
      accelerated drug development, and advance clinical management. Currently, there 
      are no molecular biomarkers in widespread clinical use for IPF, and the search 
      for potential markers remains in its infancy. Proposed core mechanisms in the 
      pathogenesis of IPF for which candidate markers have been offered include 
      alveolar epithelial cell dysfunction, immune dysregulation, and fibrogenesis. 
      Useful markers reflect important pathological pathways, are practically and 
      accurately measured, have undergone extensive validation, and are an improvement 
      upon the current approach for their intended use. The successful development of 
      useful molecular biomarkers is a central challenge for the future of 
      translational research in IPF and will require collaborative efforts among those 
      parties invested in advancing the care of patients with IPF.

PG  - 1263-72

AB  - RATIONALE: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an untreatable and often fatal 
      lung disease that is increasing in prevalence and is caused by complex 
      interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Epigenetic mechanisms 
      control gene expression and are likely to regulate the IPF transcriptome. 
      OBJECTIVES: To identify methylation marks that modify gene expression in IPF 
      lung. METHODS: We assessed DNA methylation (comprehensive high-throughput arrays 
      for relative methylation arrays [CHARM]) and gene expression (Agilent gene 
      expression arrays) in 94 patients with IPF and 67 control subjects, and performed 
      integrative genomic analyses to define methylation-gene expression relationships 
      in IPF lung. We validated methylation changes by a targeted analysis (Epityper), 
      and performed functional validation of one of the genes identified by our 
      analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We identified 2,130 differentially 
      methylated regions (DMRs; <5% false discovery rate), of which 738 are associated 
      with significant changes in gene expression and enriched for expected inverse 
      relationship between methylation and expression (P < 2.2 x 10(-16)). We validated 
      13/15 DMRs by targeted analysis of methylation. Methylation-expression 
      quantitative trait loci (methyl-eQTL) identified methylation marks that control 
      cis and trans gene expression, with an enrichment for cis relationships (P < 2.2 
      x 10(-16)). We found five trans methyl-eQTLs where a methylation change at a 
      single DMR is associated with transcriptional changes in a substantial number of 
      genes; four of these DMRs are near transcription factors (castor zinc finger 1 
      [CASZ1], FOXC1, MXD4, and ZDHHC4). We studied the in vitro effects of change in 
      CASZ1 expression and validated its role in regulation of target genes in the 
      methyl-eQTL. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that DNA methylation may be 
      involved in the pathogenesis of IPF.

TI  - beta-catenin induces A549 alveolar epithelial cell mesenchymal transition during 
      pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 2703-10
LID - 10.3892/mmr.2014.3013 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal lung disease characterized by 
      expansion of the fibroblast and myofibroblast population and extracellular matrix 
      deposition. Although the pathogenic mechanisms of IPF remain to be fully 
      elucidated, there is emerging evidence that fibroblasts and myofibroblasts may be 
      derived partially from alveolar epithelial cells by epithelial‑mesenchymal 
      transition (EMT). In the present study, A549 cells were treated with different 
      concentrations of Wnt1 and the results indicated that the mRNA and protein 
      expression levels of vimentin, alpha‑smooth muscle actin (alpha‑SMA) and collagen Ⅰ 
      gradully increased and those of E‑cadherin gradully decreased in a 
      concentration‑dependent manner. Furthermore, the A549 cells were transfected with 
      beta‑catenin plasmid cells, revealing phenotypic changes in the cells from a pebble 
      to a fusiform shape. The mRNA and protein expression levels of of vimentin, alpha‑SMA 
      and collagen Ⅰ increased significantly, whereas those of E‑cadherin decreased 
      significantly. The present study examined the roles of alveolar epithelial cell 
      injury and profibrogenic cytokine release in EMT and their association with the 
      Wnt/beta‑catenin signaling pathway in a mouse model of bleomycin‑induced pulmonary 
      fibrosis. Bronchoalveolar fluid was obtained 7 days after treatment with 
      bleomycin and the A549 cells were incubated for 48 h. An increase in the 
      expression levels of the mesenchymal markers, alpha‑SMA, vimentin and collagen Ⅰ, and 
      a concomitant decrease in the expression of the epithelial marker, E‑cadherin 
      were observed. This corresponded with an increased expression of beta‑catenin. When 
      the A549 cells were infected with a lentivirus expressing beta‑catenin shRNA, no 
      significant increase was observed in the expression of the mesenchymal cell 
      markers and the expression of E‑cadherin did not decrease. These findings 
      demonstrated that activation of the Wnt signaling pathway was capable of inducing 
      an EMT program in the lung epithelial cells through beta‑catenin and that injured 
      alveolar epithelium activated the Wnt/beta‑catenin signaling pathway, thereby 
      inducing the expansion of the fibroblast/myofibroblast population through EMT. 
      These results suggested that beta‑catenin was involved in the formation of lung 
      fibrosis and may provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of IPF.

AB  - In spite of substantial advances in defining the immunobiology and function of 
      structural cells in lung diseases there is still insufficient knowledge to 
      develop fundamentally new classes of drugs to treat many lung diseases. For 
      example, there is a compelling need for new therapeutic approaches to address 
      severe persistent asthma that is insensitive to inhaled corticosteroids. Although 
      the prevalence of steroid-resistant asthma is 5-10%, severe asthmatics require a 
      disproportionate level of health care spending and constitute a majority of fatal 
      asthma episodes. None of the established drug therapies including long-acting 
      beta agonists or inhaled corticosteroids reverse established airway remodeling. 
      Obstructive airways remodeling in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary 
      disease (COPD), restrictive remodeling in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and 
      occlusive vascular remodeling in pulmonary hypertension are similarly 
      unresponsive to current drug therapy. Therefore, drugs are needed to achieve 
      long-acting suppression and reversal of pathological airway and vascular 
      remodeling. Novel drug classes are emerging from advances in epigenetics. Novel 
      mechanisms are emerging by which cells adapt to environmental cues, which include 
      changes in DNA methylation, histone modifications and regulation of transcription 
      and translation by noncoding RNAs. In this review we will summarize current 
      epigenetic approaches being applied to preclinical drug development addressing 
      important therapeutic challenges in lung diseases. These challenges are being 
      addressed by advances in lung delivery of oligonucleotides and small molecules 
      that modify the histone code, DNA methylation patterns and miRNA function.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disease of the lung 
      parenchyma that is invariably fatal with a median survival of 2 - 3 years. 
      Despite considerable progress in defining the natural history of the disease, 
      many features of IPF pathogenesis remain poorly understood. Several recent 
      studies have highlighted links between pattern recognition receptors of innate 
      immunity termed 'Toll-like receptors' (TLRs) and the aberrant fibrogenesis that 
      characterizes IPF. AREAS COVERED: In this paper, we discuss the natural history 
      of IPF and the identification of several distinct clinical phenotypes in recent 
      years. TLRs are receptors that recognize pathogen- and/or danger-associated 
      molecular patterns and promote an appropriate immune response. We describe in 
      detail some of the recent works linking defective TLR3 function and an aggressive 
      phenotype in IPF and explore the mechanisms and potential clinical implications 
      of this initial observation. EXPERT OPINION: We explore the potential role of 
      TLRs in this setting. We discuss recent genetic studies and the implications for 
      future research. We propose a model of dysregulated innate immune recognition and 
      aberrant lung healing. The potential role of research in aiding the design of 
      clinical trials and the evidence for targeting defective TLR3 function in IPF is 
      presented.

AB  - Although aging is a known risk factor for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), 
      the pathogenic mechanisms that underlie the effects of advancing age remain 
      largely unexplained. Some age-related neurodegenerative diseases have an etiology 
      that is related to mitochondrial dysfunction. Here, we found that alveolar type 
      II cells (AECIIs) in the lungs of IPF patients exhibit marked accumulation of 
      dysmorphic and dysfunctional mitochondria. These mitochondrial abnormalities in 
      AECIIs of IPF lungs were associated with upregulation of ER stress markers and 
      were recapitulated in normal mice with advancing age in response to stimulation 
      of ER stress. We found that impaired mitochondria in IPF and aging lungs were 
      associated with low expression of PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1). 
      Knockdown of PINK1 expression in lung epithelial cells resulted in mitochondria 
      depolarization and expression of profibrotic factors. Moreover, young 
      PINK1-deficient mice developed similarly dysmorphic, dysfunctional mitochondria 
      in the AECIIs and were vulnerable to apoptosis and development of lung fibrosis. 
      Our data indicate that PINK1 deficiency results in swollen, dysfunctional 
      mitochondria and defective mitophagy, and promotes fibrosis in the aging lung.

      phenotype.

LID - 10.1152/ajplung.00043.2014 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and usually lethal 
      interstitial lung disease of unknown etiology characterized by aberrant 
      activation of epithelial cells that induce the migration, proliferation and 
      activation of fibroblasts. The resulting distinctive fibroblastic/myofibroblastic 
      foci are responsible for the excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) production and 
      abnormal lung remodeling. We have recently found that matrix metalloproteinase 19 
      (MMP-19)-deficient (Mmp19-/-) mice develop an exaggerated bleomycin-induced lung 
      fibrosis, but the mechanisms are unclear. In this study, we explored the effect 
      of MMP-19 deficiency on fibroblast gene expression and cell behavior. Microarray 
      analysis of Mmp19-/- lung fibroblasts revealed the dysregulation of several 
      profibrotic pathways, including ECM formation, migration, proliferation, and 
      autophagy. Functional studies confirmed these findings. Compared with wild-type 
      mice, Mmp19-/- lung fibroblasts showed increased alpha1 (I) collagen gene and 
      collagen protein production at baseline and after transforming growth factor-beta 
      treatment and increased smooth muscle-alpha actin expression (P < 0.05). Likewise, 
      Mmp19-deficient lung fibroblasts showed a significant increase in proliferation 
      (P < 0.01) and in transmigration and locomotion over Boyden chambers coated with 
      type I collagen or with Matrigel (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that, in lung 
      fibroblasts, MMP-19 has strong regulatory effects on the synthesis of key ECM 
      components, on fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation, and in migration and 
      proliferation.

TI  - Pathologic Regulation of Collagen I by an Aberrant Protein Phosphatase 2A/Histone 
      Deacetylase C4/MicroRNA-29 Signal Axis in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis 
      Fibroblasts.
PG  - 391-9
LID - 10.1165/rcmb.2014-0150OC [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by the relentless expansion 
      of fibroblasts depositing type I collagen within the alveolar wall and 
      obliterating the alveolar airspace. MicroRNA (miR)-29 is a potent regulator of 
      collagen expression. In IPF, miR-29 levels are low, whereas type I collagen 
      expression is high. However, the mechanism for suppression of miR-29 and 
      increased type I collagen expression in IPF remains unclear. Here we show that 
      when IPF fibroblasts are seeded on polymerized type I collagen, miR-29c levels 
      are suppressed and type I collagen expression is high. In contrast, miR-29c is 
      high and type I collagen expression is low in control fibroblasts. We demonstrate 
      that the mechanism for suppression of miR-29 during IPF fibroblast interaction 
      with polymerized collagen involves inappropriately low protein phosphatase (PP) 
      2A function, leading to histone deacetylase (HDA) C4 phosphorylation and 
      decreased nuclear translocation of HDAC4. We demonstrate that overexpression of 
      HDAC4 in IPF fibroblasts restored miR-29c levels and decreased type I collagen 
      expression, whereas knocking down HDAC4 in control fibroblasts suppressed miR-29c 
      levels and increased type I collagen expression. Our data indicate that IPF 
      fibroblast interaction with polymerized type I collagen results in an aberrant 
      PP2A/HDAC4 axis, which suppresses miR-29, causing a pathologic increase in type I 
      collagen expression.

AB  - The period covered by this update can be considered as the most exciting period 
      in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) research. It started with the 
      identification of genetic variants that are associated with IPF in the majority 
      of patients and continued with discovery of molecular and genetic biomarkers that 
      predict distinct clinical presentations of patients with IPF and potential new 
      biological mechanisms. More importantly, the period ends with the publication of 
      two groundbreaking studies that confirmed that two drugs, pirfenidone and 
      nintedanib, slowed disease progression, leading to a historic approval by the 
      FDA. In this update, we describe these key advances, their scientific and 
      significant clinical implications, and future directions.

AB  - The challenge facing many fibrotic lung diseases is that these conditions usually 
      present late, often after several decades of repetitive alveolar epithelial 
      injury, during which functional alveolar units are gradually obliterated and 
      replaced with nonfunctional connective tissue. The resulting fibrosis is often 
      progressive and, in the case of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), invariably 
      leads to respiratory insufficiency and, ultimately, the premature death of 
      affected individuals. Recent years have seen a greater appreciation of the 
      relative importance of chronic inflammation as a driver of fibrotic responses. 
      Current evidence suggests that IPF arises as a result of repetitive epithelial 
      injury and a highly aberrant wound healing response in genetically susceptible 
      and aged individuals. Nonspecific anti-inflammatory agents offer no clinical 
      benefit, but the potential contribution of maladaptive immune responses in 
      determining outcome is gaining increasing recognition. The importance of key 
      differences in the tissue-regenerative potential in young versus aged individuals 
      is also beginning to be more fully appreciated. Moreover, there is considerable 
      overlap in the mechanisms underlying tissue repair and cancer, and patients with 
      IPF are at heightened risk of developing lung cancer. Progressive fibrosis and 
      cancer may therefore represent the extremes of a highly dysregulated tissue 
      injury response. This brief review focuses on some of this evidence and on our 
      current understanding of abnormal tissue repair responses after chronic 
      epithelial injury in the specific context of IPF.

AB  - Throughout the past decade, there have been substantial advances in understanding 
      the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Recently, several large 
      genome-wide association and linkage studies have identified common genetic 
      variants in more than a dozen loci that appear to contribute to IPF risk. In 
      addition, family-based studies have led to the identification of rare genetic 
      variants in genes related to surfactant function and telomere biology, and 
      mechanistic studies suggest pathophysiological derangements associated with these 
      rare genetic variants are also found in sporadic cases of IPF. Current evidence 
      suggests that rather than existing as distinct syndromes, sporadic and familial 
      cases of IPF (familial interstitial pneumonia) probably reflect a continuum of 
      genetic risk. Rapidly evolving bioinformatic and molecular biology techniques, 
      combined with next-generation sequencing technologies, hold great promise for 
      developing a comprehensive, integrated approach to defining the fundamental 
      molecular mechanisms that underlie IPF pathogenesis.

TI  - Nintedanib modulates surfactant protein-D expression in A549 human lung 
      epithelial cells via the c-Jun N-terminal kinase-activator protein-1 pathway.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease with a high 
      mortality rate. Signalling pathways activated by several tyrosine kinase 
      receptors are known to be involved in lung fibrosis, and this knowledge has led 
      to the development of the triple tyrosine kinase inhibitor nintedanib, an 
      inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), 
      platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and fibroblast growth factor 
      receptor (FGFR), for the treatment of IPF. Pulmonary surfactant protein D (SP-D), 
      an important biomarker of IPF, reportedly attenuates bleomycin-induced pulmonary 
      fibrosis in mice. In this study, we investigated whether nintedanib modulates 
      SP-D expression in human lung epithelial (A549) cells using quantitative 
      real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. 
      To investigate the mechanisms underlying the effects of nintedanib, we evaluated 
      the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and its downstream target 
      c-Jun. The effect of the JNK inhibitor SP600125 on c-Jun phosphorylation was also 
      tested. Activation of activator protein-1 (AP-1) was examined using an 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based test, and cell proliferation assays were 
      performed to estimate the effect of nintedanib on cell proliferation. 
      Furthermore, we treated mice with nintedanib to examine its in vivo effect on 
      SP-D levels in lungs. These experiments showed that nintedanib up-regulated SP-D 
      messenger RNA expression in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations up to 5 muM, 
      with significant SP-D induction observed at concentrations of 3 muM and 5 muM, in 
      comparison with that observed in vehicle controls. Nintedanib stimulated a rapid 
      increase in phosphorylated JNK in A549 cells within 30 min of treatment and 
      stimulated c-Jun phosphorylation, which was inhibited by the JNK inhibitor 
      SP600125. Additionally, nintedanib was found to activate AP-1. A549 cell 
      proliferation was not affected by nintedanib at any of the tested concentrations. 
      Moreover, blocking FGFR, PDGFR, and VEGFR function did not affect 
      nintedanib-induced SP-D expression, suggesting that nintedanib mediates its 
      effects through a mechanism that is distinct from its known role as a tyrosine 
      kinase inhibitor. Nintedanib is also reported to inhibit Src kinase although 
      pre-treatment of cells with a Src kinase inhibitor had no effect on 
      nintedanib-induced SP-D expression. Increased expression of SFTPD mRNA and SP-D 
      protein in the lungs of nintedanib-treated mice was also observed. In this work, 
      we demonstrated that nintedanib up-regulated SP-D expression in A549 cells via 
      the JNK-AP-1 pathway and did not affect cell proliferation. This is the first 
      report describing SP-D induction by nintedanib.

LID - 10.1165/rcmb.2014-0445OC [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disease with relentless course and 
      limited therapeutic options. Nintedanib (BIBF-1120) is a multiple tyrosine kinase 
      inhibitor recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the 
      treatment of IPF. The precise antifibrotic mechanism(s) of action of nintedanib, 
      however, is not known. Therefore, we studied the effects of nintedanib on 
      fibroblasts isolated from the lungs of patients with IPF. Protein and gene 
      expression of profibrotic markers were assessed by Western immunoblotting and 
      real-time PCR. Autophagy markers and signaling events were monitored by 
      biochemical assays, Western immunoblotting, microscopy, and immunofluorescence 
      staining. Silencing of autophagy effector proteins was achieved with small 
      interfering RNAs. Nintedanib down-regulated protein and mRNA expression of 
      extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, fibronectin, and collagen 1a1 while 
      inhibiting transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1-induced myofibroblast 
      differentiation. Nintedanib also induced beclin-1-dependent, ATG7-independent 
      autophagy. Nintedanib's ECM-suppressive actions were not mediated by canonical 
      autophagy. Nintedanib inhibited early events in TGF-beta signaling, specifically 
      tyrosine phosphorylation of the type II TGF-beta receptor, activation of SMAD3, and 
      p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Nintedanib down-regulates ECM production 
      and induces noncanonical autophagy in IPF fibroblasts while inhibiting TGF-beta 
      signaling. These mechanisms appear to be uncoupled and function independently to 
      mediate its putative antifibrotic effects.

TI  - Matrix metalloproteinases as therapeutic targets for idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis.
PG  - 585-600
LID - 10.1165/rcmb.2015-0020TR [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a restrictive lung disease that is 
      associated with high morbidity and mortality. Current medical therapies are not 
      fully effective at limiting mortality in patients with IPF, and new therapies are 
      urgently needed. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are proteinases that, together, 
      can degrade all components of the extracellular matrix and numerous nonmatrix 
      proteins. MMPs and their inhibitors, tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs), have been 
      implicated in the pathogenesis of IPF based upon the results of clinical studies 
      reporting elevated levels of MMPs (including MMP-1, MMP-7, MMP-8, and MMP-9) in 
      IPF blood and/or lung samples. Surprisingly, studies of gene-targeted mice in 
      murine models of pulmonary fibrosis (PF) have demonstrated that most MMPs promote 
      (rather than inhibit) the development of PF and have identified diverse 
      mechanisms involved. These mechanisms include MMPs: (1) promoting 
      epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (MMP-3 and MMP-7); (2) increasing lung 
      levels or activity of profibrotic mediators or reducing lung levels of 
      antifibrotic mediators (MMP-3, MMP-7, and MMP-8); (3) promoting abnormal 
      epithelial cell migration and other aberrant repair processes (MMP-3 and MMP-9); 
      (4) inducing the switching of lung macrophage phenotypes from M1 to M2 types 
      (MMP-10 and MMP-28); and (5) promoting fibrocyte migration (MMP-8). Two MMPs, 
      MMP-13 and MMP-19, have antifibrotic activities in murine models of PF, and two 
      MMPs, MMP-1 and MMP-10, have the potential to limit fibrotic responses to injury. 
      Herein, we review what is known about the contributions of MMPs and TIMPs to the 
      pathogenesis of IPF and discuss their potential as therapeutic targets for IPF.

TI  - Reduced FoxO3a expression causes low autophagy in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
      fibroblasts on collagen matrices.
PG  - L552-61
LID - 10.1152/ajplung.00079.2015 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and fatal lung disease, and 
      fibroblasts derived from patients with IPF are resistant to type I collagen 
      matrix-induced cell death. The alteration of the PTEN-Akt axis permits IPF 
      fibroblasts to maintain a pathological phenotype on collagen by suppressing 
      autophagy. However, the precise underlying mechanism by which the Akt downstream 
      molecule suppresses autophagic activity remains elusive. FoxO3a is a direct 
      target of Akt and is implicated with the transcriptional activation of autophagy. 
      Therefore, we investigated whether reduced FoxO3a expression causes abnormally 
      low autophagy in IPF fibroblasts on collagen. We found that FoxO3a mRNA and 
      protein levels are low in IPF fibroblasts, which subsequently suppresses the 
      autophagosomal marker LC3B expression on collagen matrix. In contrast, the 
      majority of control fibroblasts showed an increase in FoxO3a and LC3B expression 
      at both the mRNA and protein levels. The luciferase assay confirmed that FoxO3a 
      binds to the promoter region of LC3B and transcriptionally activates LC3B. The 
      overexpression of wild-type FoxO3a increased LC3B mRNA and protein expression in 
      IPF fibroblasts, whereas the dominant negative FoxO3a decreased the LC3B level in 
      control fibroblasts. The inhibition of autophagic activity sensitized control 
      fibroblasts to collagen matrix-induced cell death. In contrast, enhanced 
      viability was found when autophagic function was inhibited in IPF fibroblasts. 
      Our study showed that aberrantly low FoxO3a expression participates in reducing 
      autophagic activity via transcriptional suppression of LC3B in IPF fibroblasts on 
      collagen. This suggests that low autophagic activity by the alteration of FoxO3a 
      may contribute to IPF progression.

TI  - Rapamycin increases CCN2 expression of lung fibroblasts via phosphoinositide 
      3-kinase.
PG  - 846-59
LID - 10.1038/labinvest.2015.68 [doi]
AB  - Excessive production of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF, CCN2) and 
      increased motor ability of the activated fibroblast phenotype contribute to the 
      pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, molecules and 
      signal pathways regulating CCN2 expression and migration of lung fibroblasts are 
      still elusive. We hypothesize that rapamycin, via binding and blocking mammalian 
      target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex (mTORC), affects CCN2 expression and migration 
      of lung fibroblasts in vitro. Primary normal and fibrotic human lung fibroblasts 
      were isolated from lung tissues of three patients with primary spontaneous 
      pneumothorax and three with IPF. Cells were incubated with regular medium, or 
      medium containing rapamycin, human recombinant transforming growth factor 
      (TGF)-beta1, or both. CCN2 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 
      expression in cells or supernatant was detected. Wound healing and migration 
      assay was used to measure the migratory potential. TGF-beta type I receptor 
      (TbetaRI)/Smad inhibitor, SB431542 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, 
      LY294002 were used to determine rapamycin's mechanism of action. We demonstrated 
      that rapamycin amplified basal or TGF-beta1-induced CCN2 mRNA and protein expression 
      in normal or fibrotic fibroblasts by Smad-independent but PI3K-dependent pathway. 
      Additionally, rapamycin also enhanced TIMP-1 expression as indicated by ELISA. 
      However, wound healing and migrating assay showed rapamycin did not affect the 
      mobility of fibroblasts. Collectively, this study implies a significant 
      fibrogenic induction activity of rapamycin by activating AKT and inducing CCN2 
      expression in vitro and provides the possible mechanisms for the in vivo findings 
      which previously showed no antifibrotic effect of rapamycin on lung fibrosis.

TI  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis landscapes: looking glass from pathology to 
      therapy.
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare chronic and ultimately fatal 
      disease resulting in an aberrant scarring and thickening of lung tissue. 
      Molecular pathogenetic mechanisms of IPF are still unknown and till now no 
      effective therapy is known to really improve disease's outcome. A deeper 
      understanding of IPF biology is now mandatory to clarify IPF origin in order to 
      identify actionable targets. Here we discuss and analyze the data presented by a 
      recent paper published by De Pianto et al. on the prestigious respiratory journal 
      Thorax. The work is focused on how gene expression analysis can be applied to 
      stratify IPF cases based on their risk of disease progression. Moreover they 
      tried to match genetic and phenotypic profiles in order to predict therapeutic 
      response and patients' prognosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The beneficial outcome associated with the use of proton pump 
      inhibitors (PPIs) in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has been reported in 
      retrospective studies. To date, no prospective study has been conducted to 
      confirm these outcomes. In addition, the potential mechanism by which PPIs 
      improve measures of lung function and/or transplant-free survival in IPF has not 
      been elucidated. METHODS: Here, we used biochemical, cell biological and 
      preclinical studies to evaluate regulation of markers associated with 
      inflammation and fibrosis. In our in vitro studies, we exposed primary lung 
      fibroblasts, epithelial and endothelial cells to ionizing radiation or bleomycin; 
      stimuli typically used to induce inflammation and fibrosis. In addition, we 
      cultured lung fibroblasts from IPF patients and studied the effect of 
      esomeprazole on collagen release. Our preclinical study tested efficacy of 
      esomeprazole in a rat model of bleomycin-induced lung injury. Furthermore, we 
      performed retrospective analysis of interstitial lung disease (ILD) databases to 
      examine the effect of PPIs on transplant-free survival. RESULTS: The cell culture 
      studies revealed that esomeprazole controls inflammation by suppressing the 
      expression of pro-inflammatory molecules including vascular cell adhesion 
      molecule-1, inducible nitric oxide synthase, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) 
      and interleukins (IL-1beta and IL-6). The antioxidant effect is associated with 
      strong induction of the stress-inducible cytoprotective protein heme oxygenase-1 
      (HO1) and the antifibrotic effect is associated with potent inhibition of 
      fibroblast proliferation as well as downregulation of profibrotic proteins 
      including receptors for transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta), fibronectin and 
      matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Furthermore, esomeprazole showed robust effect 
      in mitigating the inflammatory and fibrotic responses in a murine model of acute 
      lung injury. Finally, retrospective analysis of two ILD databases was performed 
      to assess the effect of PPIs on transplant-free survival in IPF patients. 
      Intriguingly, this data demonstrated that IPF patients on PPIs had prolonged 
      survival over controls (median survival of 3.4 vs 2 years). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, 
      these data indicate the possibility that PPIs may have protective function in IPF 
      by directly modulating the disease process and suggest that they may have other 
      clinical utility in the treatment of extra-intestinal diseases characterized by 
      inflammatory and/or fibrotic phases.

      pulmonary fibrosis.

LID - 10.1136/thoraxjnl-2014-206411 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Activation and differentiation of fibroblasts into contractile 
      protein-expressing myofibroblasts and their acquired apoptosis-resistant 
      phenotype are critical factors towards the development of idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF), a fatal disease characterised by distorted pulmonary structure 
      and excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. The molecular mechanisms 
      underlying these processes in IPF remain incompletely understood. We investigated 
      the possible implication of aberrant overexpression and activity of histone 
      deacetylases (HDACs) in IPF. METHODS: We analysed lung tissues from patients with 
      sporadic IPF (n=26) and non-diseased control lungs (n=16) for expression of class 
      I and II HDACs. Primary IPF fibroblasts were treated with HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) 
      LBH589 or valproic acid (VPA). RESULTS: Compared to control lungs, protein levels 
      of class I (HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, HDAC8) and class II HDACs (HDAC4, HDAC 5, HDAC 
      7, HDAC 9) were significantly elevated in IPF lungs. Using immunohistochemistry, 
      strong induction of nearly all HDAC enzymes was observed in myofibroblasts of 
      fibroblast foci and in abnormal bronchiolar basal cells at sites of aberrant 
      re-epithelialisation in IPF lungs, but not in controls. Treatment of primary IPF 
      fibroblasts with the pan-HDACi LBH589 resulted in significantly reduced 
      expression of genes associated with ECM synthesis, proliferation and cell 
      survival, as well as in suppression of HDAC7, and was paralleled by induction of 
      endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis. The profibrotic and 
      apoptosis-resistant phenotype of IPF fibroblasts was also partly attenuated by 
      the class I HDACi VPA. CONCLUSIONS: Aberrant overexpression of HDACs in basal 
      cells of IPF lungs may contribute to the bronchiolisation process in this 
      disease. Similarly, generation and apoptosis resistance of IPF fibroblasts are 
      mediated by enhanced activity of HDAC enzymes. Therefore, pan-HDAC inhibition by 
      LBH589 may present a novel therapeutic option for patients with IPF.

AB  - To identify microRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) with potential roles in lung fibrogenesis, 
      we performed genome-wide profiling of miRNA expression in lung tissues from a 
      silica-induced mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis using microarrays. Seventeen 
      miRNAs were selected for validation via qRT-PCR based on the fold changes between 
      the silica and the control group. The dysregulation of five miRNAs, including 
      miR-21, miR-455, miR-151-3p, miR-486-5p and miR-3107, were confirmed by qRT-PCRs 
      in silica-induced mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis and were also confirmed in a 
      bleomycin (BLM)-induced mouse lung fibrosis. Notably, miR-486-5p levels were 
      decreased in the serum samples of patients with silicosis, as well as in the lung 
      tissues of patients with silicosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). In 
      addition, as determined by luciferase assays and Western blotting, SMAD2, a 
      crucial mediator of pulmonary fibrosis, was identified to be one of target genes 
      of miR-486-5p. To test the potential therapeutic significance of this miRNA, we 
      overexpressed miR-486-5p in animal models. At day 28, miR-486-5p expression 
      significantly decreased both the distribution and severity of lung lesions 
      compared with the silica group (P < 0.01). In addition, miR-486-5p had a similar 
      effect in the BLM group (P < 0.001). These results indicate that miR-486-5p may 
      inhibit fibrosis.

TI  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and lung cancer: a clinical and pathogenesis 
      update.
PG  - 626-33
LID - 10.1097/MCP.0000000000000217 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: About one out of 10 patients with idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF) develop lung cancer. This review provides an epidemiology and 
      clinical update of the association of these two lethal diseases. In addition, we 
      focus on the emerging overlapping epigenetic mechanisms in both diseases. RECENT 
      FINDINGS: In a vast majority of cases, lung cancer is diagnosed during the 
      clinical and radiological follow-up for the fibrosis. The risk of development of 
      lung cancer in IPF is higher for older male smokers and there is a significantly 
      higher prevalence of lung cancer in the combined IPF and emphysema syndrome 
      compared with fibrosis only. The association of two lethal diseases, such as IPF 
      and lung cancer, carries a very poor outcome and the correct treatment strategy, 
      particularly for advanced forms of lung cancer, is still unclear. SUMMARY: The 
      two novel drugs approved for IPF, pirfenidone and nintedanib, open a new scenario 
      in which treated patients with fibrosis will live longer, and possibly have a 
      lower incidence of lung cancer. However, prospective studies are urgently needed 
      to definitively clarify the role of lung cancer treatment in the management of 
      IPF patients. Furthermore, common epigenetic alterations may represent a 
      promising target for therapeutic approaches in the near future.

TI  - Down-regulation of USP13 mediates phenotype transformation of fibroblasts in 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal disease characterized 
      by fibroblastic foci and progressive scarring of the pulmonary parenchyma. IPF 
      fibroblasts display increased proliferation and enhanced migration and invasion, 
      analogous to cancer cells. This transformation-like phenotype of fibroblasts 
      plays an important role in the development of pulmonary fibrosis, but the 
      mechanism for this is not well understood. METHODS: In this study, we compared 
      gene expression profiles in fibrotic lung tissues from IPF patients and normal 
      lung tissues from patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax using a cDNA 
      microarray to examine the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of IPF. In a 
      cDNA microarray, we found that USP13 was decreased in lung tissues from patients 
      with IPF, which was further confirmed by results from immunohistochemistry and 
      western blot assays. Then, we used RNA interference in MRC-5 cells to inhibit 
      USP13 and evaluated its effects by western blot, real-time RT-PCR, 
      bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, and transwell assays. We also used 
      co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence staining to identify the 
      correlation between USP13 and PTEN in IPF. RESULTS: USP13 expression levels were 
      markedly reduced in fibroblastic foci and primary IPF fibroblast lines. The 
      depletion of USP13 resulted in the transformation of fibroblasts into an 
      aggressive phenotype with enhanced proliferative, migratory, and invasive 
      capacities. Additionally, USP13 interacted with PTEN and mediated PTEN 
      ubiquitination and degradation in lung fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: Down-regulation 
      of USP13 mediates PTEN protein loss and fibroblast phenotypic change, and thereby 
      plays a crucial role in IPF pathogenesis.

TI  - Novel mechanisms and treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 145-53
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating progressive disease of 
      unknown etiology that carries a grim prognosis. Over the last few decades there 
      have been significant advances in our understanding of the mechanisms that drive 
      the fibrotic process. In this review, we discuss the natural history of IPF, 
      recent discoveries of the genetic factors, and environmental and infectious 
      exposures that influence the development and progression of the disease, and 
      highlight some of the novel discoveries in our understanding of the mechanisms 
      that govern lung fibrosis. Finally, we discuss the new and exciting therapies 
      that are now available to manage this illness.

TI  - Protease activated receptor-1 regulates macrophage-mediated cellular senescence: 
      a risk for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 35304-14
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.6095 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a destructive disease in part resulting 
      from premature or mature cellular aging. Protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) 
      recently emerged as a critical component in the context of fibrotic lung 
      diseases. Therefore, we aimed to study the role of macrophages in PAR-1-mediated 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The number of macrophages were significantly 
      reduced in lungs of PAR-1 antagonist (P1pal-12) treated animals upon bleomycin 
      instillation. In line with these data, PAR-1 stimulation increased monocyte / 
      macrophage recruitment in response to epithelium injury in in vitro trans-well 
      assays. Moreover, macrophages induced fibroblasts migration, differentiation and 
      secretion of collagen, which were inhibited in the presence of TGF-beta receptor 
      inhibitors. Interestingly, these profibrotic effects were partially inhibited by 
      treatment with the PAR-1 inhibitor P1pal-12. Using shRNA mediated PAR-1 knock 
      down in fibroblasts, we demonstrate that fibroblast PAR-1 contributes to TGF-beta 
      activation and production. Finally, we show that the macrophage-dependent 
      induction of PAR-1 driven TGF-beta activation was mediated by FXa. Our data identify 
      novel mechanisms by which PAR-1 stimulation on different cell types can 
      contribute to IPF and identify macrophages as key players in PAR-1 dependent 
      development of this devastating disease. IPF may result from cellular senescence 
      mediated by macrophages in the lung.

TI  - Poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) mediates 3'-end maturation of the telomerase 
      RNA component.
PG  - 1482-8
LID - 10.1038/ng.3423 [doi]
AB  - Mutations in the PARN gene (encoding poly(A)-specific ribonuclease) cause 
      telomere diseases including familial idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and 
      dyskeratosis congenita, but how PARN deficiency impairs telomere maintenance is 
      unclear. Here, using somatic cells and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) 
      from patients with dyskeratosis congenita with PARN mutations, we show that PARN 
      is required for the 3'-end maturation of the telomerase RNA component (TERC). 
      Patient-derived cells as well as immortalized cells in which PARN is disrupted 
      show decreased levels of TERC. Deep sequencing of TERC RNA 3' termini shows that 
      PARN is required for removal of post-transcriptionally acquired oligo(A) tails 
      that target nuclear RNAs for degradation. Diminished TERC levels and the 
      increased proportion of oligo(A) forms of TERC are normalized by restoring PARN, 
      which is limiting for TERC maturation in cells. Our results demonstrate a new 
      role for PARN in the biogenesis of TERC and provide a mechanism linking PARN 
      mutations to telomere diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that circulating fibrocytes and endothelial 
      cells actively participate in the intense remodelling of the pulmonary 
      vasculature in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Indeed, 
      fibrotic areas exist that have fewer blood vessels, whereas adjacent non-fibrotic 
      tissue is highly vascularized. The number of circulating endothelial cells (CEC) 
      and endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) might reflect the balance between vascular 
      injury and repair. Thus, fibrocytes as well as endothelial cells could 
      potentially be used as biomarkers of disease progression and treatment outcome. 
      METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were collected from 67 patients with a 
      multidisciplinary diagnosis of IPF and from 45 age-matched and sex-matched 
      healthy volunteers. Buffy coat was isolated according to standard procedures and 
      at least 20 million cells were stained with different monoclonal antibodies for 
      the detection of CEC, EPC and circulating fibrocytes. For the detection of CEC 
      and EPC, cells were stained with anti-CD45, anti-CD34, anti-CD133, anti-CD14, 
      anti-CD309 and with the viability probe Far-Red LIVE/DEAD. For the detection of 
      circulating fibrocytes, cells were first stained with LIVE/DEAD and the following 
      monoclonal antibodies: anti-CD3, anti-CD19, anti-CD45, anti-CD34 and anti-CD14, 
      then cells were fixed, permeabilized and stained with fluorochrome-conjugated 
      anti-collagen I monoclonal antibodies. RESULTS: Patients with IPF displayed 
      almost undetectable levels of circulating fibrocytes, low levels of CEC, and 
      normal levels of EPC. Patients treated with nintedanib displayed higher levels of 
      CEC, but lower levels of endothelial cells expressing CD309 (the type II receptor 
      for vascular endothelial growth factor). Treatment with both nintedanib and 
      pirfenidone reduced the percentage of CEC and circulating fibrocytes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Levels of CEC were reduced in patients with IPF as compared to 
      healthy individuals. The anti-fibrotic treatments nintedanib and pirfenidone 
      further reduced CEC levels. These findings might help explain the mechanism of 
      action of these drugs and should be explored as predictive biomarkers in IPF.

TI  - Integrative phenotyping framework (iPF): integrative clustering of multiple omics 
      data identifies novel lung disease subphenotypes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The increased multi-omics information on carefully phenotyped 
      patients in studies of complex diseases requires novel methods for data 
      integration. Unlike continuous intensity measurements from most omics data sets, 
      phenome data contain clinical variables that are binary, ordinal and categorical. 
      RESULTS: In this paper we introduce an integrative phenotyping framework (iPF) 
      for disease subtype discovery. A feature topology plot was developed for 
      effective dimension reduction and visualization of multi-omics data. The approach 
      is free of model assumption and robust to data noises or missingness. We 
      developed a workflow to integrate homogeneous patient clustering from different 
      omics data in an agglomerative manner and then visualized heterogeneous 
      clustering of pairwise omics sources. We applied the framework to two batches of 
      lung samples obtained from patients diagnosed with chronic obstructive lung 
      disease (COPD) or interstitial lung disease (ILD) with well-characterized 
      clinical (phenomic) data, mRNA and microRNA expression profiles. Application of 
      iPF to the first training batch identified clusters of patients consisting of 
      homogenous disease phenotypes as well as clusters with intermediate disease 
      characteristics. Analysis of the second batch revealed a similar data structure, 
      confirming the presence of intermediate clusters. Genes in the intermediate 
      clusters were enriched with inflammatory and immune functional annotations, 
      suggesting that they represent mechanistically distinct disease subphenotypes 
      that may response to immunomodulatory therapies. The iPF software package and all 
      source codes are publicly available. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of subclusters 
      with distinct clinical and biomolecular characteristics suggests that integration 
      of phenomic and other omics information could lead to identification of novel 
      mechanism-based disease sub-phenotypes.

TI  - Epigenetic regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 by methylation of c8orf4 in pulmonary 
      fibrosis.
PG  - 575-86
LID - 10.1042/CS20150697 [doi]
AB  - Fibroblasts derived from the lungs of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
      (IPF) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) produce low levels of prostaglandin (PG) E2, 
      due to a limited capacity to up-regulate cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). This 
      deficiency contributes functionally to the fibroproliferative state, however the 
      mechanisms responsible are incompletely understood. In the present study, we 
      examined whether the reduced level of COX-2 mRNA expression observed in fibrotic 
      lung fibroblasts is regulated epigenetically. The DNA methylation inhibitor, 
      5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5AZA) restored COX-2 mRNA expression by fibrotic lung 
      fibroblasts dose dependently. Functionally, this resulted in normalization of 
      fibroblast phenotype in terms of PGE2 production, collagen mRNA expression and 
      sensitivity to apoptosis. COX-2 methylation assessed by bisulfite sequencing and 
      methylation microarrays was not different in fibrotic fibroblasts compared with 
      controls. However, further analysis of the methylation array data identified a 
      transcriptional regulator, chromosome 8 open reading frame 4 (thyroid cancer 
      protein 1, TC-1) (c8orf4), which is hypermethylated and down-regulated in 
      fibrotic fibroblasts compared with controls. siRNA knockdown of c8orf4 in control 
      fibroblasts down-regulated COX-2 and PGE2 production generating a phenotype 
      similar to that observed in fibrotic lung fibroblasts. Chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation demonstrated that c8orf4 regulates COX-2 expression in lung 
      fibroblasts through binding of the proximal promoter. We conclude that the 
      decreased capacity of fibrotic lung fibroblasts to up-regulate COX-2 expression 
      and COX-2-derived PGE2 synthesis is due to an indirect epigenetic mechanism 
      involving hypermethylation of the transcriptional regulator, c8orf4.

TI  - miR-26a suppresses EMT by disrupting the Lin28B/let-7d axis: potential 
      cross-talks among miRNAs in IPF.
PG  - 655-65
LID - 10.1007/s00109-016-1381-8 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive, and highly lethal 
      fibrotic lung disease with unknown cause or cure. Although some microRNAs 
      (miRNAs), such as miR-26a and let-7d, have been confirmed, the contribution to 
      the pathophysiological processes of IPF, the roles of miRNAs and intrinsic links 
      between them in fibrotic lung diseases are not yet well understood. In this 
      study, we found that Lin28B could induce the process of epithelial-mesenchymal 
      transition (EMT) by inhibiting let-7d, whereas inhibition of Lin28B mitigated 
      TGF-beta1-induced fibrogenesis and attenuated EMT in both cultured A549 cells and 
      MLE-12 cells. More importantly, over-expression of miR-26a could simultaneously 
      enhance the expression of let-7d in A549 cells, and further study confirmed that 
      Lin28B was one of the direct targets of miR-26a, which mediates, at least in 
      part, the regulatory effects of miR-26a on the biogenesis of let-7d. Finally, we 
      constructed a regulatory network among miRNAs involved in the progression of IPF. 
      Taken together, our study deciphered the essential role of Lin28B in the 
      pathogenesis of EMT, and unraveled a novel mechanism that miR-26a is a modulator 
      of let-7d. This study also defines the miRNAs network involved in IPF, which may 
      have implications for developing new strategies for pulmonary fibrosis. KEY 
      MESSAGE: Upregulation of Lin28B contributes to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. 
      Lin28B causes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by inhibition of let-7d. 
      Lin28B is one of the targets of microRNA-26a. miR-26a enhances the expression of 
      let-7d via targeting regulation of Lin28B. A regulatory network among miRNAs 
      involved in the progression of IPF.

TI  - Integrated long non-coding RNA analyses identify novel regulators of 
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 1234-46
LID - 10.1111/jcmm.12783 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic fatal lung disease characterized 
      by aberrant accumulation of fibroblast population and deposition of extra 
      cellular matrix. Increasing evidence support that epithelial-mesenchymal 
      transition (EMT) of alveolar epithelial cells is a critical process in the 
      pathogenesis of IPF. Although delivery of bleomycin to induce acute lung injury 
      is the most well-studied animal model of pulmonary fibrosis, there is 
      considerable interest to pursue other models to understand the common and/or 
      specific pathological mechanisms. In this study, we established a mouse model of 
      pulmonary injury and progressive interstitial fibrosis via intraperitoneal 
      injection of paraquat, a widely used herbicide known to cause pulmonary fibrosis 
      in human. Using transcriptome sequencing and microarray analysis, we profiled 
      expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and identified 513 up-regulated and 
      204 down-regulated lncRNAs in paraquat-induced fibrotic lung tissues. Gene 
      ontology analysis revealed that the differentially expressed lncRNAs are 
      implicated in cell differentiation, epithelium morphogenesis and wound healing, 
      pathways closely associated with EMT. Furthermore, we identified the 
      evolutionally conserved target genes of two up-regulated lncRNAs, uc.77 and 
      2700086A05Rik, as Zeb2 and Hoxa3, respectively, both of which are important 
      modulators of EMT. Consistently, overexpression of uc.77 or 2700086A05Rik in 
      human lung epithelial cells induced EMT as demonstrated by changes in gene and 
      protein expression of various EMT markers and cell morphology. Collectively, our 
      results uncovered a crucial role of lncRNA in the regulation of EMT during lung 
      fibrosis and provide potential avenues for the discovery of novel molecular 
      markers and therapeutic targets for IPF.

TI  - Effects of the tumor suppressor PTEN on the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis in Chinese patients.
PG  - 2715-23
LID - 10.3892/mmr.2016.4852 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by progressive interstitial 
      fibrosis, and is associated with a fatal outcome. The critical pathological 
      mechanisms underlying IPF are largely unknown; however, accumulating evidence has 
      indicated similarities between IPF and cancer. Therefore, the present study 
      examined the expression levels of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin 
      homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) in Chinese patients with IPF, using an 
      enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay. To determine the effects of PTEN on the 
      development of pulmonary fibrosis, PTEN was overexpressed in transforming growth 
      factor (TGF)‑beta1‑treated human embryonic lung fibroblasts (HFL‑I cells). The serum 
      levels of PTEN were significantly lower in 42 patients with IPF, as compared with 
      in the healthy controls. In addition, PTEN overexpression enhanced apoptosis, and 
      suppressed basal levels of proliferation and migration in fibroblasts. Notably, 
      PTEN was able to specifically inhibit TGF‑beta1‑induced proliferation and migration 
      of the cells. Overexpression of PTEN also suppressed phosphorylation of Akt and 
      Smad3, and decreased the expression levels of numerous proteins with critical 
      roles in TGF‑beta1‑induced fibrosis, including alpha‑smooth muscle actin, matrix 
      metalloproteinase (MMP)‑2 and MMP‑9. These results indicated that PTEN may 
      inhibit TGF‑beta1‑mediated myofibroblast differentiation of fibroblasts by 
      attenuating signaling via the phosphatidylinositol 3‑kinase/Akt and TGF‑beta/Smad3 
      pathways.

TI  - Reduced Ets Domain-containing Protein Elk1 Promotes Pulmonary Fibrosis via 
      Increased Integrin alphavbeta6 Expression.
PG  - 9540-53
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M115.692368 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fibrotic lung disease with 
      high mortality. Active TGFbeta1 is considered central to the pathogenesis of IPF. A 
      major mechanism of TGFbeta1 activation in the lung involves the epithelially 
      restricted alphavbeta6 integrin. Expression of the alphavbeta6 integrin is dramatically 
      increased in IPF. How alphavbeta6 integrin expression is regulated in the pulmonary 
      epithelium is unknown. Here we identify a region in the beta6 subunit gene (ITGB6) 
      promoter acting to markedly repress basal gene transcription, which responds to 
      both the Ets domain-containing protein Elk1 (Elk1) and the glucocorticoid 
      receptor (GR). Both Elk1 and GR can regulate alphavbeta6 integrin expression in vitro We 
      demonstrate Elk1 binding to the ITGB6 promoter basally and that manipulation of 
      Elk1 or Elk1 binding alters ITGB6 promoter activity, gene transcription, and alphavbeta6 
      integrin expression. Crucially, we find that loss of Elk1 causes enhanced Itgb6 
      expression and exaggerated lung fibrosis in an in vivo model of fibrosis, whereas 
      the GR agonist dexamethasone inhibits Itgb6 expression. Moreover, Elk1 
      dysregulation is present in epithelium from patients with IPF. These data reveal 
      a novel role for Elk1 regulating ITGB6 expression and highlight how dysregulation 
      of Elk1 can contribute to human disease.

TI  - WISP1 mediates IL-6-dependent proliferation in primary human lung fibroblasts.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal interstitial lung 
      disease. IPF is characterized by epithelial cell injury and reprogramming, 
      increases in (myo)fibroblasts, and altered deposition of extracellular matrix. 
      The Wnt1-inducible signaling protein 1 (WISP1) is involved in impaired 
      epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk in pulmonary fibrosis. Here, we aimed to further 
      investigate WISP1 regulation and function in primary human lung fibroblasts 
      (phLFs). We demonstrate that WISP1 is directly upregulated by Transforming growth 
      factor beta1 (TGFbeta1) and Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) in phLFs, using a 
      luciferase-based reporter system. WISP1 mRNA and protein secretion increased in a 
      time- and concentration-dependent manner by TGFbeta1 and TNFalpha in phLFs, as analysed 
      by qPCR and ELISA, respectively. Notably, WISP1 is required for TGFbeta1- and 
      TNFalpha-dependent induction of interleukin 6 (IL-6), a mechanism that is conserved 
      in IPF phLFs. The siRNA-mediated WISP1 knockdown led to a significant IL-6 
      reduction after TGFbeta1 or TNFalpha stimulation. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated 
      downregulation or antibody-mediated neutralization of WISP1 reduced phLFs 
      proliferation, a process that was in part rescued by IL-6. Taken together, these 
      results strongly indicate that WISP1-induced IL-6 expression contributes to the 
      pro-proliferative effect on fibroblasts, which is likely orchestrated by a 
      variety of profibrotic mediators, including Wnts, TGFbeta1 and TNFalpha.

TI  - Chop Deficiency Protects Mice Against Bleomycin-induced Pulmonary Fibrosis by 
      Attenuating M2 Macrophage Production.
PG  - 915-25
LID - 10.1038/mt.2016.36 [doi]
AB  - C/EBP homologous protein (Chop) has been shown to have altered expression in 
      patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), but its exact role in IPF 
      pathoaetiology has not been fully addressed. Studies conducted in patients with 
      IPF and Chop(-/-) mice have dissected the role of Chop and endoplasmic reticulum 
      (ER) stress in pulmonary fibrosis pathogenesis. The effect of Chop deficiency on 
      macrophage polarization and related signalling pathways were investigated to 
      identify the underlying mechanisms. Patients with IPF and mice with bleomycin 
      (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis were affected by the altered Chop expression and 
      ER stress. In particular, Chop deficiency protected mice against BLM-induced lung 
      injury and fibrosis. Loss of Chop significantly attenuated transforming growth 
      factor beta (TGF-beta) production and reduced M2 macrophage infiltration in the lung 
      following BLM induction. Mechanistic studies showed that Chop deficiency 
      repressed the M2 program in macrophages, which then attenuated TGF-beta secretion. 
      Specifically, loss of Chop promoted the expression of suppressors of cytokine 
      signaling 1 and suppressors of cytokine signaling 3, and through which Chop 
      deficiency repressed signal transducer and activator of transcription 
      6/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma signaling, the essential 
      pathway for the M2 program in macrophages. Together, our data support the idea 
      that Chop and ER stress are implicated in IPF pathoaetiology, involving at least 
      the induction and differentiation of M2 macrophages.

TI  - The matricellular protein CCN1 enhances TGF-beta1/SMAD3-dependent profibrotic 
      signaling in fibroblasts and contributes to fibrogenic responses to lung injury.
PG  - 2135-50
LID - 10.1096/fj.201500173 [doi]
AB  - Matricellular proteins mediate pleiotropic effects during tissue injury and 
      repair. CCN1 is a matricellular protein that has been implicated in angiogenesis, 
      inflammation, and wound repair. In this study, we identified CCN1 as a gene that 
      is differentially up-regulated in alveolar mesenchymal cells of human subjects 
      with rapidly progressive idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Elevated levels of 
      CCN1 mRNA were confirmed in lung tissues of IPF subjects undergoing lung 
      transplantation, and CCN1 protein was predominantly localized to fibroblastic 
      foci. CCN1 expression in ex vivo IPF lung fibroblasts correlated with gene 
      expression of the extracellular matrix proteins, collagen (Col)1a1, Col1a2, and 
      fibronectin as well as the myofibroblast marker, alpha-smooth muscle actin. RNA 
      interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of CCN1 down-regulated the constitutive 
      expression of these profibrotic genes in IPF fibroblasts. TGF-beta1, a known 
      mediator of tissue fibrogenesis, induces gene and protein expression of CCN1 via 
      a mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3 (SMAD3)-dependent mechanism. 
      Importantly, endogenous CCN1 potentiates TGF-beta1-induced SMAD3 activation and 
      induction of profibrotic genes, supporting a positive feedback loop leading to 
      myofibroblast activation. In vivo RNAi-mediated silencing of CCN1 attenuates 
      fibrogenic responses to bleomycin-induced lung injury. These studies support 
      previously unrecognized, cooperative interaction between the CCN1 matricellular 
      protein and canonical TGF-beta1/SMAD3 signaling that promotes lung 
      fibrosis.-Kurundkar, A. R., Kurundkar, D., Rangarajan, S., Locy, M. L., Zhou, Y.,

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and lethal disease of 
      unknown etiology. A growing body of evidence indicates that it may result from an 
      aberrant activation of alveolar epithelium, which induces the expansion of the 
      fibroblast population, their differentiation to myofibroblasts and the excessive 
      accumulation of extracellular matrix. The mechanisms that activate the alveolar 
      epithelium are unknown, but several studies indicate that smoking is the main 
      environmental risk factor for the development of IPF. In this study we explored 
      the effect of cigarette smoke on the gene expression profile and signaling 
      pathways in alveolar epithelial cells. Lung epithelial cell line from human 
      (A549), was exposed to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) for 1, 3, and 5 weeks at 1, 
      5 and 10% and gene expression was evaluated by complete transcriptome 
      microarrays. Signaling networks were analyzed with the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis 
      software. At 5 weeks of exposure, alveolar epithelial cells acquired a 
      fibroblast-like phenotype. At this time, gene expression profile revealed a 
      significant increase of more than 1000 genes and deregulation of canonical 
      signaling pathways such as TGF-beta and Wnt. Several profibrotic genes involved in 
      EMT were over-expressed, and incomplete EMT was observed in these cells, and 
      corroborated in mouse (MLE-12) and rat (RLE-6TN) epithelial cells. The secretion 
      of activated TGF-beta1 increased in cells exposed to cigarette smoke, which 
      decreased when the integrin alpha v gene was silenced. These findings suggest 
      that the exposure of alveolar epithelial cells to CSE induces the expression and 
      release of a variety of profibrotic genes, and the activation of TGF-beta1, which 
      may explain at least partially, the increased risk of developing IPF in smokers.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a life-threatening disease with limited 
      treatment options. Additionally, the lack of a complete understanding of 
      underlying immunological mechanisms underscores the importance of discovering 
      novel options for therapeutic intervention. Since the PI3K/PTEN pathway in 
      myeloid cells influences their effector functions, we wanted to elucidate how 
      sustained PI3K activity induced by cell-type specific genetic deficiency of its 
      antagonist PTEN modulates IPF, in a murine model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary 
      fibrosis (BIPF). We found that myeloid PTEN deficient mice (PTEN(MyKO)), after 
      induction of BIPF, exhibit increased TGF-beta1 activation, mRNA expression of 
      pro-collagens and lysyl oxidase as well as augmented collagen deposition compared 
      to wild-type littermates, leading to enhanced morbidity and decreased survival. 
      Analysis of alveolar lavage and lung cell composition revealed that PTEN(MyKO) 
      mice exhibit reduced numbers of macrophages and T-cells in response to bleomycin, 
      indicating an impaired recruitment function. Interestingly, we found dysregulated 
      macrophage polarization as well as elevated expression and release of the 
      pro-fibrotic cytokines IL-6 and TNF-alpha in PTEN(MyKO) mice during BIPF. This might 
      point to an uncontrolled wound healing response in which the inflammatory as well 
      as tissue repair mechanisms proceed in parallel, thereby preventing resolution 
      and at the same time promoting extensive fibrosis.

TI  - Elevated expression of NEU1 sialidase in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis provokes 
      pulmonary collagen deposition, lymphocytosis, and fibrosis.
PG  - L940-54
LID - 10.1152/ajplung.00346.2015 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) poses challenges to understanding its 
      underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms and the development of better 
      therapies. Previous studies suggest a pathophysiological role for neuraminidase 1 
      (NEU1), an enzyme that removes terminal sialic acid from glycoproteins. We 
      observed increased NEU1 expression in epithelial and endothelial cells, as well 
      as fibroblasts, in the lungs of patients with IPF compared with healthy control 
      lungs. Recombinant adenovirus-mediated gene delivery of NEU1 to cultured primary 
      human cells elicited profound changes in cellular phenotypes. Small airway 
      epithelial cell migration was impaired in wounding assays, whereas, in pulmonary 
      microvascular endothelial cells, NEU1 overexpression strongly impacted global 
      gene expression, increased T cell adhesion to endothelial monolayers, and 
      disrupted endothelial capillary-like tube formation. NEU1 overexpression in 
      fibroblasts provoked increased levels of collagen types I and III, substantial 
      changes in global gene expression, and accelerated degradation of matrix 
      metalloproteinase-14. Intratracheal instillation of NEU1 encoding, but not 
      control adenovirus, induced lymphocyte accumulation in bronchoalveolar lavage 
      samples and lung tissues and elevations of pulmonary transforming growth factor-beta 
      and collagen. The lymphocytes were predominantly T cells, with CD8(+) cells 
      exceeding CD4(+) cells by nearly twofold. These combined data indicate that 
      elevated NEU1 expression alters functional activities of distinct lung cell types 
      in vitro and recapitulates lymphocytic infiltration and collagen accumulation in 
      vivo, consistent with mechanisms implicated in lung fibrosis.

AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), one of the clinical common 
      diseases, shares similar pathogenesis with ancient disease "Feibi" in Chinese 
      medicine, Renshen pingfei decoction (RPFS), a classical prescription, was 
      commonly used in treating Feibi. In the current study, the protective role of 
      RPFS in rats model of IPF and the mechanism via regulation of TGF-beta1/Smad3, were 
      evaluated and explored. METHODS: The chemicals of RPFS were analyzed by 
      UPLC-QTOF-MS. Under the optimized chromatographic and MS condition, the major 
      components in RPFS were well separated and detected. An IPF model was established 
      in rats which were induced with Bleomycin (BLM). After treated with corresponding 
      medicine for 7 days, 14 days, 21 days and 28 days respectively, lung function of 
      rats were measured; peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were 
      assessed; histopathological changes and homogenate of lung tissue were detected; 
      TGF-beta1 and Smad3 mRNA and protein expressions in lung tissue were examined as 
      well. RESULTS: 43 signal peaks of chemical components in RPFS were identified by 
      UPLC-QTOF-MS method. Compared with model group, RPFS group exerted significant 
      effects on IPF model rats in improving lung function and decreasing HYP content 
      of lung tissue (P<0.01), reducing the level of TGF-beta1 and NFkappaB in BALF (P<0.05), 
      decreasing SOD and MDA level in serum (P<0.01), as well as down-regulating TGF-beta1 
      and Smad3 mRNA and protein expressions of lung tissue (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: RPFS 
      could reduce the lung injury and fibrosis degree and improve lung function of IPF 
      model rats. The protective role might mediated by down-regulating TGF-beta1/Smad3 
      signaling pathway.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disease characterized by 
      progressive deterioration of the alveolar integrity. Among IPF identified 
      phenotypes, that of familial (f-)IPF is usually associated with several gene 
      mutations which are seldom observed in sporadic (s-)IPF. This study aimed at 
      investigating the molecular patterns and variability in f-IPF and s-IPF patients 
      through a differential proteomic analysis. Protein patterns of bronchoalveolar 
      lavage fluid (BALF) samples from 10 familial and 17 sporadic IPF patients were 
      compared using 2D electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Principal component 
      analysis (PCA) was applied to proteomic data and an enrichment analysis was also 
      performed to characterize specific pathogenic mechanisms and to identify 
      potential biomarkers. BALF samples from f-IPF showed 87 protein spots 
      differentially expressed than those from s-IPF samples; once identified, these 
      spots revealed 22 unique proteins. The functional analysis showed that the 
      endothelial reticulum stress probably plays a central pathogenetic role in f-IPF 
      with an up-regulation of proteins involved in wounding and immune responses, 
      coagulation system, and ion homeostasis. Up-regulated proteins in the s-IPF group 
      were those involved in the oxidative stress response. PCA analysis of 
      differentially expressed proteins clearly distinguished f-IPF from s-IPF 
      patients, and in agreement with radiological and histological patterns, pointed 
      out a higher heterogeneity in f-IPF than s-IPF samples. The 'Slit/Robo 
      signaling', 'clathrin-coated vesicle' and 'cytoskeleton remodelling', were 
      extrapolated by 'pathways analysis' and the results of 'diseases (by biomarkers)' 
      highlighted a 'connective tissue and autoimmune disease', two aspects of 
      increasing interest in IPF.

      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

AB  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease 
      characterized by irreversible airflow limitation. Cigarette smoking represents 
      the main risk factor, but the specific mechanisms of COPD are not completely 
      understood. Our aim was to identify COPD-specific proteomic changes involved in 
      disease onset and severity. A comparative proteomic analysis of 51 lung tissues 
      from nonsmokers, smokers, smokers with mild to moderate (stage I-II) COPD, severe 
      to very severe COPD (stage III-IV), and patients with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency 
      (AATD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) was performed by cysteine-specific 
      two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) coupled with mass 
      spectrometry. Selected COPD-specific changes were validated by immunoblotting and 
      further by ELISA in 120 induced sputum and plasma samples from nonsmokers, 
      smokers, and patients with COPD (stage I-III). Altogether 82 altered proteins 
      were identified comprising COPD-, AATD-, and IPF-specific, overlapping, and 
      unspecific changes. Cathepsin D (CTSD), dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 2 
      (DPYSL2), transglutaminase 2 (TGM2), and tripeptidyl-peptidase 1 (TPP1) were 
      validated as COPD-specific. TGM2 was not associated with smoking and correlated 
      with COPD severity in lung tissue. TGM2 levels in sputum and plasma were elevated 
      in patients with COPD (stage II-III) and correlated with lung function. In 
      conclusion, new proteins related to COPD onset and severity could be identified 
      with TGM2 being a novel potential diagnostic and therapeutic target for COPD. 
      Further studies in carefully characterized cohorts are required to validate the 
      identified changes.

TI  - Integrated Genomics Reveals Convergent Transcriptomic Networks Underlying Chronic 
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.
PG  - 948-960
AB  - RATIONALE: Despite shared environmental exposures, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
      (IPF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are usually studied in isolation, 
      and the presence of shared molecular mechanisms is unknown. OBJECTIVES: We 
      applied an integrative genomic approach to identify convergent transcriptomic 
      pathways in emphysema and IPF. METHODS: We defined the transcriptional repertoire 
      of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, IPF, or normal histology lungs using 
      RNA-seq (n = 87). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Genes increased in both 
      emphysema and IPF relative to control were enriched for the p53/hypoxia pathway, 
      a finding confirmed in an independent cohort using both gene expression arrays 
      and the nCounter Analysis System (n = 193). Immunohistochemistry confirmed 
      overexpression of HIF1A, MDM2, and NFKBIB members of this pathway in tissues from 
      patients with emphysema or IPF. Using reads aligned across splice junctions, we 
      determined that alternative splicing of p53/hypoxia pathway-associated molecules 
      NUMB and PDGFA occurred more frequently in IPF or emphysema compared with control 
      and validated these findings by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and the 
      nCounter Analysis System on an independent sample set (n = 193). Finally, by 
      integrating parallel microRNA and mRNA-Seq data on the same samples, we 
      identified MIR96 as a key novel regulatory hub in the p53/hypoxia gene-expression 
      network and confirmed that modulation of MIR96 in vitro recapitulates the 
      disease-associated gene-expression network. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest 
      convergent transcriptional regulatory hubs in diseases as varied phenotypically 
      as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and IPF and suggest that these hubs may 
      represent shared key responses of the lung to environmental stresses.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interstitial pneumonia in connective tissue diseases (CTD-IP) 
      featuring inflammation and fibrosis is a leading cause of death in CTD-IP 
      patients. The related autoimmune lung injury and disturbed self-healing process 
      make conventional anti-inflammatory drugs ineffective. Equipped with unique 
      immunoregulatory and regenerative properties, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) may 
      represent a promising therapeutic agent in CTD-IP. In this study, we aim to 
      define the immunopathology involved in pulmonary exacerbation during autoimmunity 
      and to determine the potential of MSCs in correcting these disorders. METHODS: 
      Lung and blood specimens, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells collected from 
      CTD-IP patients, and human primary lung fibroblasts (HLFs) from patients 
      pathologically diagnosed with usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) and healthy 
      controls were analyzed by histology, flow cytometry and molecular biology. T cell 
      subsets involved in the process of CTD-IP were defined, while the regulatory 
      functions of MSCs isolated from the bone marrow of normal individuals (HBMSCs) on 
      cytotoxic T cells and CTD-UIP HLFs were investigated in vitro. RESULTS: Higher 
      frequencies of cytotoxic T cells were observed in the lung and peripheral blood 
      of CTD-IP patients, accompanied with a reduced regulatory T cell (Treg) level. 
      CTD-UIP HLFs secreted proinflammatory cytokines in combination with upregulation 
      of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA). The addition of HBMSCs in vitro increased Tregs 
      concomitant with reduced cytotoxic T cells in an experimental cell model with 
      dominant cytotoxic T cells, and promoted Tregs expansion in T cell subsets from 
      patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). HBMSCs also significantly 
      decreased proinflammatory chemokine/cytokine expression, and blocked alpha-SMA 
      activation in CTD-UIP HLFs through a TGF-beta1-mediated mechanism, which modulates 
      excessive IL-6/STAT3 signaling leading to IP-10 expression. MSCs secreting a 
      higher level of TGF-beta1 appear to have an optimal anti-fibrotic efficacy in 
      BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. CONCLUSIONS: Impairment of TGF-beta signal 
      transduction relevant to a persistent IL-6/STAT3 transcriptional activation 
      contributes to reduction of Treg differentiation in CTD-IP and to myofibroblast 
      differentiation in CTD-UIP HLFs. HBMSCs can sensitize TGF-beta1 downstream signal 
      transduction that regulates IL-6/STAT3 activation, thereby stimulating Treg 
      expansion and facilitating anti-fibrotic IP-10 production. This may in turn block 
      progression of lung fibrosis in autoimmunity.

TI  - Ubiquitin E3 ligase FIEL1 regulates fibrotic lung injury through SUMO-E3 ligase 
      PIAS4.
PG  - 1029-46
LID - 10.1084/jem.20151229 [doi]
AB  - The E3 small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) protein ligase protein inhibitor of 
      activated STAT 4 (PIAS4) is a pivotal protein in regulating the TGFbeta pathway. In 
      this study, we discovered a new protein isoform encoded by KIAA0317, termed 
      fibrosis-inducing E3 ligase 1 (FIEL1), which potently stimulates the TGFbeta 
      signaling pathway through the site-specific ubiquitination of PIAS4. FIEL1 
      targets PIAS4 using a double locking mechanism that is facilitated by the kinases 
      PKCzeta and GSK3beta. Specifically, PKCzeta phosphorylation of PIAS4 and GSK3beta 
      phosphorylation of FIEL1 are both essential for the degradation of PIAS4. FIEL1 
      protein is highly expressed in lung tissues from patients with idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), whereas PIAS4 protein levels are significantly reduced. 
      FIEL1 overexpression significantly increases fibrosis in a bleomycin murine 
      model, whereas FIEL1 knockdown attenuates fibrotic conditions. Further, we 
      developed a first-in-class small molecule inhibitor toward FIEL1 that is highly 
      effective in ameliorating fibrosis in mice. This study provides a basis for IPF 
      therapeutic intervention by modulating PIAS4 protein abundance.

TI  - What We Know About the Pathogenesis of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.
PG  - 358-67
LID - 10.1055/s-0036-1580693 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive lung disease of 
      unknown cause, occurring in adults, limited to the lungs and associated with the 
      pathologic and radiologic pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia. Prognosis is 
      poor, and most patients die of respiratory failure within 3 to 6 years from the 
      onset of symptoms. Although our understanding of the pathogenesis of IPF has 
      improved over the past two decades, the mechanisms responsible for this disorder 
      have not been clearly defined. Aging is the single most important risk factor, 
      but genetic, environmental, and diverse exogenous factors such as smoking, viral 
      infections, chronic tissue injury (i.e., gastroesophageal reflux disease, 
      traction injury) play contributory roles. In this review, we focus on 
      pathogenetic mechanisms that we think are crucial for the initiation of the 
      fibrotic process and for its progressive evolution. In the early stage of the 
      disease, in the context of the permissive genetic background combined with the 
      presence of specific risk factors, alveolar epithelial cells play a leading role. 
      Subsequent evolution of the fibrotic process and its lethal progression is likely 
      due to the abnormal tissue repair process that takes place in the lung and to the 
      inability to counteract this process. In this phase of the disease, fibroblasts 
      assume a crucial role. Current pharmacological treatment strategies for IPF have 
      only modest value, principally by slowing the course of disease progression. 
      Unfortunately, improvement or cure has not yet been achieved with pharmacological 
      agents. The challenge for the future is to improve the comprehension of the 
      mechanisms involved in the inception and evolution of IPF and their articulated 
      interactions. This is fundamental not only to conceive and develop new drugs 
      against this dreadful disease but also to apply different therapeutic approaches 
      such as drug repositioning and personalized therapies in the management of IPF.

LID - 10.1080/15384101.2016.1152435 [doi]
AB  - Fibrosis, a progressive accumulation of extracellular matrix components, 
      encompasses a wide spectrum of distinct organs, and accounts for an increasing 
      burden of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite the tremendous clinical 
      impact, the mechanisms governing the fibrotic process are not yet understood, and 
      to date, no clinically reliable therapies for fibrosis have been discovered. Here 
      we applied Regeneration Intelligence, a new bioinformatics software suite for 
      qualitative analysis of intracellular signaling pathway activation using 
      transcriptomic data, to assess a network of molecular signaling in lung and liver 
      fibrosis. In both tissues, our analysis detected major conserved signaling 
      pathways strongly associated with fibrosis, suggesting that some of the pathways 
      identified by our algorithm but not yet wet-lab validated as fibrogenesis 
      related, may be attractive targets for future research. While the majority of 
      significantly disrupted pathways were specific to histologically distinct organs, 
      several pathways have been concurrently activated or downregulated among the 
      hepatic and pulmonary fibrosis samples, providing new evidence of evolutionary 
      conserved pathways that may be relevant as possible therapeutic targets. While 
      future confirmatory studies are warranted to validate these observations, our 
      platform proposes a promising new approach for detecting fibrosis-promoting 
      pathways and tailoring the right therapy to prevent fibrogenesis.

PG  - L238-54
LID - 10.1152/ajplung.00142.2016 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal lung disease of unknown etiology. 
      The development of pulmonary hypertension (PH) is considered the single most 
      significant predictor of mortality in patients with chronic lung diseases. The 
      processes that govern the progression and development of fibroproliferative and 
      vascular lesions in IPF are not fully understood. Using human lung explant 
      samples from patients with IPF with or without a diagnosis of PH as well as 
      normal control tissue, we report reduced BMPR2 expression in patients with IPF or 
      IPF+PH. These changes were consistent with dampened P-SMAD 1/5/8 and elevated 
      P-SMAD 2/3, demonstrating reduced BMPR2 signaling and elevated TGF-beta activity in 
      IPF. In the bleomycin (BLM) model of lung fibrosis and PH, we also report 
      decreased BMPR2 expression compared with control animals that correlated with 
      vascular remodeling and PH. We show that genetic abrogation or pharmacological 
      inhibition of interleukin-6 leads to diminished markers of fibrosis and PH 
      consistent with elevated levels of BMPR2 and reduced levels of a collection of 
      microRNAs (miRs) that are able to degrade BMPR2. We also demonstrate that 
      isolated bone marrow-derived macrophages from BLM-exposed mice show reduced BMPR2 
      levels upon exposure with IL6 or the IL6+IL6R complex that are consistent with 
      immunohistochemistry showing reduced BMPR2 in CD206 expressing macrophages from 
      lung sections from IPF and IPF+PH patients. In conclusion, our data suggest that 
      depletion of BMPR2 mediated by a collection of miRs induced by IL6 and subsequent 
      STAT3 phosphorylation as a novel mechanism participating to fibroproliferative 
      and vascular injuries in IPF.

AB  - Pathologic features of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) include genetic 
      predisposition, activation of the unfolded protein response, telomere attrition, 
      and cellular senescence. The mechanisms leading to alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) 
      senescence are poorly understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported as 
      regulators of cellular senescence. Senescence markers including p16, p21, p53, 
      and senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-betagal) activity were measured in 
      type II AECs from IPF lungs and unused donor lungs. miRNAs were quantified in 
      type II AECs using gene expression arrays and quantitative RT-PCR. Molecular 
      markers of senescence (p16, p21, and p53) were elevated in IPF type II AECs. 
      SA-betagal activity was detected in a greater percentage in type II AECs isolated 
      from IPF patients (23.1%) compared to patients with other interstitial lung 
      diseases (1.2%) or normal controls (0.8%). The relative levels of 
      senescence-associated miRNAs miR-34a, miR-34b, and miR-34c, but not miR-20a, 
      miR-29c, or miR-let-7f were significantly higher in type II AECs from IPF 
      patients. Overexpression of miR-34a, miR-34b, or miR-34c in lung epithelial cells 
      was associated with higher SA-betagal activity (27.8%, 35.1%, and 38.2%, 
      respectively) relative to control treated cells (8.8%). Targets of miR-34 miRNAs, 
      including E2F1, c-Myc, and cyclin E2, were lower in IPF type II AECs. These 
      results show that markers of senescence are uniquely elevated in IPF type II AECs 
      and suggest that the miR-34 family of miRNAs regulate senescence in IPF type II 
      AECs.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and usually lethal disease 
      of unknown aetiology. A growing body of evidence supports that IPF represents an 
      epithelial-driven process characterised by aberrant epithelial cell behaviour, 
      fibroblast/myofibroblast activation and excessive accumulation of extracellular 
      matrix with the subsequent destruction of the lung architecture. The mechanisms 
      involved in the abnormal hyper-activation of the epithelium are unclear, but we 
      propose that recapitulation of pathways and processes critical to embryological 
      development associated with a tissue specific age-related stochastic epigenetic 
      drift may be implicated. These pathways may also contribute to the distinctive 
      behaviour of IPF fibroblasts. Genomic and epigenomic studies have revealed that 
      wingless/Int, sonic hedgehog and other developmental signalling pathways are 
      reactivated and deregulated in IPF. Moreover, some of these pathways cross-talk 
      with transforming growth factor-beta activating a profibrotic feedback loop. The 
      expression pattern of microRNAs is also dysregulated in IPF and exhibits a 
      similar expression profile to embryonic lungs. In addition, senescence, a process 
      usually associated with ageing, which occurs early in alveolar epithelial cells 
      of IPF lungs, likely represents a conserved programmed developmental mechanism. 
      Here, we review the major developmental pathways that get twisted in IPF, and 
      discuss the connection with ageing and potential therapeutic approaches.

TI  - Fibroblast growth factor-1 attenuates TGF-beta1-induced lung fibrosis.
PG  - 197-210

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by progressive fibroblast 
      and myofibroblast proliferation, and extensive deposition of extracellular matrix 
      (ECM). Fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1) belongs to the FGF family and has been 
      shown to inhibit fibroblast collagen production and differentiation into 
      myofibroblasts, and revert epithelial-mesenchymal transition by inhibiting TGF-beta1 
      signalling pathways. However, the precise role of FGF-1 in pulmonary fibrosis has 
      not yet been elucidated. In this study, we explore the mechanisms underlying the 
      anti-fibrogenic effect of FGF-1 in pulmonary fibrosis in vitro and in vivo by 
      prolonged transient overexpression of FGF-1 (AdFGF-1) and TGF-beta1 (AdTGF-beta1) using 
      adenoviral vectors. In vivo, FGF-1 overexpression markedly attenuated 
      TGF-beta1-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rat lungs when given both concomitantly, or 
      delayed, by enhancing proliferation and hyperplasia of alveolar epithelial cells 
      (AECs). AdFGF-1 also attenuated the TGF-beta1 signalling pathway and induced FGFR1 
      expression in AECs. In vitro, AdFGF-1 prevented the increase in alpha-SMA and the 
      decrease in E-cadherin induced by AdTGF-beta1 in normal human lung fibroblasts, 
      primary human pulmonary AECs, and A549 cells. Concomitantly, AdTGF-beta1-induced 
      Smad2 phosphorylation was significantly reduced by AdFGF-1 in both cell types. 
      AdFGF-1 also attenuated the increase in TGFbetaR1 protein and mRNA levels in 
      fibroblasts. In AECs, AdFGF-1 decreased TGFbetaR1 protein by favouring TGFbetaR1 
      degradation through the caveolin-1/proteasome pathway. Furthermore, FGFR1 
      expression was increased in AECs, whereas it was decreased in fibroblasts. In 
      serum of IPF patients, FGF-1 levels were increased compared to controls. 
      Interestingly, FGF-1 expression was restricted to areas of AEC hyperplasia, but 
      not alpha-SMA-positive areas in IPF lung tissue. Our results demonstrate that FGF-1 
      may have preventative and therapeutic effects on TGF-beta1-driven pulmonary fibrosis 
      via inhibiting myofibroblast differentiation, inducing AEC proliferation, 
      regulating TGF-beta1 signalling by controlling TGFbetaR1 expression and degradation, 
      and regulating FGFR1 expression. Thus, modulating FGF-1 signalling represents a 
      potential therapy for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis. Copyright (c) 2016

TI  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis landscapes: looking glass from pathology to 
      therapy.
PG  - 17-24
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare chronic and ultimately fatal 
      disease resulting in an aberrant scarring and thickening of lung tissue. 
      Molecular pathogenetic mechanisms of IPF are still unknown and till now no 
      effective therapy is known to really improve disease's outcome. A deeper 
      understanding of IPF biology is now mandatory to clarify IPF origin in order to 
      identify actionable targets. Here we discuss and analyze the data presented by a 
      recent paper published by De Pianto et al. on the prestigious respiratory journal 
      Thorax. The work is focused on how gene expression analysis can be applied to 
      stratify IPF cases based on their risk of disease progression. Moreover they 
      tried to match genetic and phenotypic profiles in order to predict therapeutic 
      response and patients' prognosis.

TI  - Regulation of LOXL2 and SERPINH1 by antitumor microRNA-29a in lung cancer with 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 985-993
LID - 10.1038/jhg.2016.99 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive lung disease that 
      is refractory to treatment and carries a high mortality rate. IPF is frequently 
      associated with lung cancer. Identification of molecular targets involved in both 
      diseases may elucidate novel molecular mechanisms contributing to their 
      pathology. Recent studies of microRNA (miRNA) expression signatures showed that 
      microRNA-29a (miR-29a) was downregulated in IPF and lung cancer. The aim of this 
      study was to investigate the functional significance of miR-29a in lung cancer 
      cells (A549 and EBC-1) and lung fibroblasts (MRC-5) and to identify molecular 
      targets modulated by miR-29a in these cells. We confirmed the downregulation of 
      miR-29a in clinical specimens of IPF and lung cancer. Restoration of miR-29a 
      suppressed cancer cell aggressiveness and fibroblast migration. A combination of 
      gene expression data and in silico analysis showed that a total of 24 genes were 
      putative targets of miR-29a. Among them, lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2) and serpin 
      peptidase inhibitor clade H, member 1 (SERPINH1) were direct targets of miR-29a 
      by luciferase reporter assays. The functions of LOXL2 and SERPINH1 contribute 
      significantly to collagen biosynthesis. Overexpression of LOXL2 and SERPINH1 was 
      observed in clinical specimens of lung cancer and fibrotic lesions. 
      Downregulation of miR-29a caused overexpression of LOXL2 and SERPINH1 in lung 
      cancer and IPF, suggesting that these genes are involved in the pathogenesis of 
      these two diseases.

AB  - In spite of advances in the diagnosis and current molecular target therapies of 
      lung cancer, this disease remains the most common cause of cancer-related death 
      worldwide. Approximately 80% of lung cancers is non-small cell lung cancer 
      (NSCLC), and 5-year survival rate of the disease is ~20%. On the other hand, 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive interstitial lung 
      disease of unknown etiology. IPF is refractory to treatment and has a very low 
      survival rate. Moreover, IPF is frequently associated with lung cancer. However, 
      the common mechanisms shared by these two diseases remain poorly understood. In 
      the post-genome sequence era, the discovery of noncoding RNAs, particularly 
      microRNAs (miRNAs), has had a major impact on most biomedical fields, and these 
      small molecules have been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of NSCLC and 
      IPF. Investigation of novel RNA networks mediated by miRNAs has improved our 
      understanding of the molecular mechanisms of these diseases. This review 
      summarizes our current knowledge on aberrantly expressed miRNAs regulating NSCLC 
      and IPF based on miRNA expression signatures.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating, progressive disease with 
      poor survival rates and limited treatment options. Upregulation of alphavbeta6 integrins 
      within the alveolar epithelial cells is a characteristic feature of IPF and 
      correlates with poor patient survival. The pro-fibrotic cytokine TGFbeta1 can 
      upregulate alphavbeta6 integrin expression but the molecular mechanisms driving this 
      effect have not previously been elucidated. We confirm that stimulation with 
      exogenous TGFbeta1 increases expression of the integrin beta6 subunit gene (ITGB6) and 
      alphavbeta6 integrin cell surface expression in a time- and concentration-dependent 
      manner. TGFbeta1-induced ITGB6 expression occurs via transcriptional activation of 
      the ITGB6 gene, but does not result from effects on ITGB6 mRNA stability. Basal 
      expression of ITGB6 in, and alphavbeta6 integrins on, lung epithelial cells occurs via 
      homeostatic alphavbeta6-mediated TGFbeta1 activation in the absence of exogenous 
      stimulation, and can be amplified by TGFbeta1 activation. Fundamentally, we show for 
      the first time that TGFbeta1-induced ITGB6 expression occurs via canonical Smad 
      signalling since dominant negative constructs directed against Smad3 and 4 
      inhibit ITGB6 transcriptional activity. Furthermore, disruption of a Smad binding 
      site at -798 in the ITGB6 promoter abolishes TGFbeta1-induced ITGB6 transcriptional 
      activity. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation we demonstrate that TGFbeta1 
      stimulation of lung epithelial cells results in direct binding of Smad3, and 
      Smad4, to the ITGB6 gene promoter within this region. Finally, using an 
      adenoviral TGFbeta1 over-expression model of pulmonary fibrosis we demonstrate that 
      Smad3 is crucial for TGFbeta1-induced alphavbeta6 integrin expression within the alveolar 
      epithelium in vivo. Together, these data confirm that a homeostatic, autocrine 
      loop of alphavbeta6 integrin activated TGFbeta1-induced ITGB6 gene expression regulates 
      epithelial basal alphavbeta6 integrin expression, and demonstrates that this occurs via 
      Smad-dependent transcriptional regulation at a single Smad binding site in the 
      promoter of the beta6 subunit gene. Active TGFbeta1 amplifies this pathway both in 
      vitro and in vivo, which may promote fibrosis.

TI  - Epigenetic Regulation of Caveolin-1 Gene Expression in Lung Fibroblasts.
PG  - 50-61
LID - 10.1165/rcmb.2016-0034OC [doi]
AB  - Fibrotic disorders are associated with tissue accumulation of fibroblasts. We 
      recently showed that caveolin (Cav)-1 gene suppression by a profibrotic cytokine, 
      transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, contributes to fibroblast proliferation and 
      apoptosis resistance. Cav-1 has been shown to be constitutively suppressed in 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), but mechanisms for this suppression are 
      incompletely understood. We hypothesized that epigenetic processes contribute to 
      Cav-1 down-regulation in IPF lung fibroblasts, and after fibrogenic stimuli. 
      Cav-1 expression levels, DNA methylation status, and histone modifications 
      associated with the Cav-1 promoter were examined by PCR, Western blots, 
      pyrosequencing, or chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in IPF lung fibroblasts, 
      normal fibroblasts after TGF-beta1 stimulation, or in murine lung fibroblasts after 
      bleomycin injury. Methylation-specific PCR demonstrated methylated and 
      unmethylated Cav-1 DNA copies in all groups. Despite significant changes in Cav-1 
      expression, no changes in DNA methylation were observed in CpG islands or CpG 
      island shores of the Cav-1 promoter by pyrosequencing of lung fibroblasts from 
      IPF lungs, in response to TGF-beta1, or after bleomycin-induced murine lung injury, 
      when compared with respective controls. In contrast, the association of Cav-1 
      promoter with the active histone modification mark, H3 lysine 4 trimethylation, 
      correlated with Cav-1 down-regulation in activated/fibrotic lung fibroblasts. Our 
      data indicate that Cav-1 gene silencing in lung fibroblasts is actively regulated 
      by epigenetic mechanisms that involve histone modifications, in particular H3 
      lysine 4 trimethylation, whereas DNA methylation does not appear to be a primary 
      mechanism. These findings support therapeutic strategies that target histone 
      modifications to restore Cav-1 expression in fibroblasts participating in 
      pathogenic tissue remodeling.

TI  - Metformin attenuates lung fibrosis development via NOX4 suppression.
PG  - 107
LID - 10.1186/s12931-016-0420-x [doi]
LID - 107
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accumulation of profibrotic myofibroblasts in fibroblastic foci (FF) 
      is a crucial process for development of fibrosis during idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF) pathogenesis, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta plays a key 
      regulatory role in myofibroblast differentiation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
      has been proposed to be involved in the mechanism for TGF-beta-induced myofibroblast 
      differentiation. Metformin is a biguanide antidiabetic medication and its 
      pharmacological action is mediated through the activation of AMP-activated 
      protein kinase (AMPK), which regulates not only energy homeostasis but also 
      stress responses, including ROS. Therefore, we sought to investigate the 
      inhibitory role of metformin in lung fibrosis development via modulating TGF-beta 
      signaling. METHODS: TGF-beta-induced myofibroblast differentiation in lung 
      fibroblasts (LF) was used for in vitro models. The anti-fibrotic role of 
      metfromin was examined in a bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung fibrosis model. RESULTS: 
      We found that TGF-beta-induced myofibroblast differentiation was clearly inhibited 
      by metformin treatment in LF. Metformin-mediated activation of AMPK was 
      responsible for inhibiting TGF-beta-induced NOX4 expression. NOX4 knockdown and 
      N-acetylcysteine (NAC) treatment illustrated that NOX4-derived ROS generation was 
      critical for TGF-beta-induced SMAD phosphorylation and myofibroblast 
      differentiation. BLM treatment induced development of lung fibrosis with 
      concomitantly enhanced NOX4 expression and SMAD phosphorylation, which was 
      efficiently inhibited by metformin. Increased NOX4 expression levels were also 
      observed in FF of IPF lungs and LF isolated from IPF patients. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      findings suggest that metformin can be a promising anti-fibrotic modality of 
      treatment for IPF affected by TGF-beta.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) identifies a specific lung 
      disorder characterized by chronic, progressive fibrosing interstitial pneumonia 
      of unknown etiology, which lacks effective treatment. According to the current 
      pathogenic perspective, the aberrant proliferative events in IPF resemble those 
      occurring during malignant transformation. MAIN BODY: Receptor tyrosine kinases 
      (RTK) are known to be key players in cancer onset and progression. It has been 
      demonstrated that RTK expression is sometimes also altered and even druggable in 
      IPF. One example of an RTK-the MET proto-oncogene-is a key regulator of invasive 
      growth. This physiological genetic program supports embryonic development and 
      post-natal organ regeneration, as well as cooperating in the evolution of cancer 
      metastasis when aberrantly activated. Growing evidence sustains that MET 
      activation may collaborate in maintaining tissue plasticity and the regenerative 
      potential that characterizes IPF. CONCLUSION: The present work aims to 
      elucidate-by applying the logic of simplicity-the bio-molecular mechanisms 
      involved in MET activation in IPF. This clarification is crucial to accurately 
      design MET blockade strategies within a fully personalized approach to IPF.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic fibrosing interstitial pneumonia 
      of unknown cause, characterised by progressive worsening in lung function and 
      dyspnoea with an associated prognosis similar to or worse than many cancers. As a 
      better understanding emerges around the pathogenesis and mechanisms driving 
      disease pathology, a host of novel agents are being tested both pre-clinically 
      and clinically. However even with this deeper understanding and positive 
      pre-clinical supportive data, negative trial outcomes are frequently reported, 
      highlighting the problems faced in treating such a heterogeneous disease with a 
      varied clinical course. Recently, two therapies that slow disease progression, 
      nintedanib and pirfenidone, have been approved for the treatment of IPF, yet the 
      clinical unmet need is still high for IPF patients given their failure to stop 
      disease progression and their potential side-effect profiles. Efforts are being 
      made to not only understand the underlying pathways and genetics that might 
      influence the clinical course of the disease, but also the non-invasive 
      biomarkers that reflect the activity of specific pathways which in turn may 
      highlight progressive treatment plans for individual patients. The cumulative 
      data may be based on the identification of subgroups of patients via biomarker 
      analysis of ongoing clinical trials, or investigation of cohorts of patients over 
      time to understand the relative role of these mediators in their disease 
      progression. Below we review the ongoing quest for novel therapeutic approaches 
      and highlight, where appropriate attempts have been made to identify patients for 
      which a specific pathway or mediator may be driving disease progression.

AB  - Pulmonary fibrosis, characterized by the destruction of lung tissue architecture 
      and the formation of fibrous foci, currently has no satisfactory treatment. 
      Emodin is a component of Chinese herb that has been reported to be medicable on 
      pancreatic fibrosis and liver fibrosis. However, its role in pulmonary fibrosis 
      has not been reported yet. In the present study, we investigated the hypothesis 
      that H19 play a promotive role in bleomycin-induced epithelial-mesenchymal 
      transition of alveolar epithelial cell, and H19 exerts its effect through miR-29b 
      regulation. H19 expression was positively correlated with COL1A1 and Acta2 
      expression; H19 knockdown inhibited COL1A1 and Acta2 expression. Moreover, H19 
      interacted with miR-29b through directly binding to the 3'UTR; miR-29b inhibited 
      COL1A1 expression by directly binding to the 3'UTR. In conclusion, we revealed 
      the promotive effect of H19 on BLM-induced IPF, and demonstrated the mechanism by 
      which H19/miR-29b interaction exerts its effect on regulating pulmonary fibrosis. 
      The present study provided a potential therapy to treat IPF.

TI  - Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis: A Genetic Disease That Involves Mucociliary 
      Dysfunction of the Peripheral Airways.
PG  - 1567-91
LID - 10.1152/physrev.00004.2016 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an incurable complex genetic disorder that 
      is associated with sequence changes in 7 genes (MUC5B, TERT, TERC, RTEL1, PARN, 
      SFTPC, and SFTPA2) and with variants in at least 11 novel loci. We have 
      previously found that 1) a common gain-of-function promoter variant in MUC5B 
      rs35705950 is the strongest risk factor (genetic and otherwise), accounting for 
      30-35% of the risk of developing IPF, a disease that was previously considered 
      idiopathic; 2) the MUC5B promoter variant can potentially be used to identify 
      individuals with preclinical pulmonary fibrosis and is predictive of radiologic 
      progression of preclinical pulmonary fibrosis; and 3) MUC5B may be involved in 
      the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis with MUC5B message and protein expressed 
      in bronchiolo-alveolar epithelia of IPF and the characteristic IPF honeycomb 
      cysts. Based on these considerations, we hypothesize that excessive production of 
      MUC5B either enhances injury due to reduced mucociliary clearance or impedes 
      repair consequent to disruption of normal regenerative mechanisms in the distal 
      lung. In aggregate, these novel considerations should have broad impact, 
      resulting in specific etiologic targets, early detection of disease, and novel 
      biologic pathways for use in the design of future intervention, prevention, and 
      mechanistic studies of IPF.

TI  - Baicalin attenuates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis via adenosine A2a 
      receptor related TGF-beta1-induced ERK1/2 signaling pathway.
PG  - 132
LID - 132
AB  - BACKGROUND: Baicalin has been reported to have anti-fibrosis effect; however, its 
      mechanism still remains to be elucidated. Adenosine A2a receptor (A2aR) is a 
      novel inflammation regulator, and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1)-induced 
      extracellular signal regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway plays an 
      important role in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). This study was to explore 
      the relationship of A2aR and TGF-beta1-induced ERK1/2 in bleomycin (BLM)-induced 
      pulmonary fibrosis in mice, and to investigate whether A2aR mediate the 
      anti-fibrosis effect of Baicalin on BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis. METHODS: The 
      A2aR-/- and A2aR+/+ mice were respectively divided into three groups: control 
      group, model group, baicalin group. Pulmonary fibrosis was induced in mice of 
      model groups by intratracheal instillation of bleomycin, and baicalin was 
      administered in mice of baicalin groups daily for 28 days. Histopathological and 
      ultrastructural changes of lung tissues were evaluated. Lung coefficient and the 
      levels of hydroxyproline (HYP) in lung tissues were measured at the same time. 
      The levels of serum TGF-beta1 were measured by ELISA. The expression of TGF-beta1, 
      ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2 and A2aR were detected by western blot and immunohistochemical 
      staining techniques. RESULTS: Severe lung fibrosis was observed in the 
      bleomycin-treated mice on day 28. The histopathological findings and collagen 
      content of lung tissues were much severer/higher in A2aR-/- mice than in A2aR+/+ 
      mice. We also showed that TGF-beta1 and p-ERK1/2 were upregulated in 
      bleomycin-treated mice and expressed higher in A2aR-/- mice compared to A2aR+/+ 
      mice. Besides, bleomycin-treated A2aR+/+ mice had increased A2aR level in lungs. 
      However, long-term treatment with baicalin in A2aR-/- and A2aR+/+ mice 
      significantly ameliorated the histopathological changes in lungs. Moreover, 
      Increased TGF-beta1 and p-ERK1/2 expressions in bleomycin-treated A2aR-/- and 
      A2aR+/+ mice were obviously diminished by baicalin. The baicalin-treated A2aR-/- 
      mice had severer lung fibrosis and higher expressions of TGF-beta1 and p-ERK1/2 than 
      A2aR+/+ mice. Baicalin has also upregulated the expression of A2aR in A2aR+/+ 
      mice. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic inactivation of A2aR exacerbated the pathological 
      processes of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Together, baicalin could 
      inhibit BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis by upregulating A2aR, suggesting A2aR as a 
      therapeutic target of baicalin for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is progressive and rapidly fatal. 
      Improved understanding of pathogenesis is required to prosper novel therapeutics. 
      Epigenetic changes contribute to IPF; therefore, microRNAs may reveal novel 
      pathogenic pathways. OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the regulatory role of 
      microRNA (miR)-155 in the profibrotic function of murine lung macrophages and 
      fibroblasts, IPF lung fibroblasts, and its contribution to experimental pulmonary 
      fibrosis. METHODS: Bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in wild-type and miR-155(-/-) 
      mice was analyzed by histology, collagen, and profibrotic gene expression. 
      Mechanisms were identified by in silico and molecular approaches and validated in 
      mouse lung fibroblasts and macrophages, and in IPF lung fibroblasts, using 
      loss-and-gain of function assays, and in vivo using specific inhibitors. RESULTS: 
      miR-155(-/-) mice developed exacerbated lung fibrosis, increased collagen 
      deposition, collagen 1 and 3 mRNA expression, TGF-beta production, and activation of 
      alternatively activated macrophages, contributed by deregulation of the miR-155 
      target gene the liver X receptor (LXR)alpha in lung fibroblasts and macrophages. 
      Inhibition of LXRalpha in experimental lung fibrosis and in IPF lung fibroblasts 
      reduced the exacerbated fibrotic response. Similarly, enforced expression of 
      miR-155 reduced the profibrotic phenotype of IPF and miR-155(-/-) fibroblasts. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We describe herein a molecular pathway comprising miR-155 and its 
      epigenetic LXRalpha target that when deregulated enables pathogenic pulmonary 
      fibrosis. Manipulation of the miR-155/LXR pathway may have therapeutic potential 
      for IPF.

TI  - MicroRNA-29c regulates apoptosis sensitivity via modulation of the cell-surface 
      death receptor, Fas, in lung fibroblasts.
PG  - L1050-L1061
LID - 10.1152/ajplung.00252.2016 [doi]
AB  - MicroRNAs play an important role in the development and progression of various 
      diseases, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Although the accumulation 
      of aberrant fibroblasts resistant to apoptosis is a hallmark in IPF lungs, the 
      mechanism regulating apoptosis susceptibility is not fully understood. Here, we 
      investigated the role of miR-29, which is the most downregulated microRNA in IPF 
      lungs and is also known as a regulator of extracellular matrix (ECM), in the 
      mechanism of apoptosis resistance. We found that functional inhibition of miR-29c 
      caused resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis in lung fibroblasts. Furthermore, 
      experiments using miR-29c inhibitor and miR-29c mimic revealed that miR-29c 
      regulated expression of the death receptor, Fas, and formation of death-inducing 
      signaling complex leading to extrinsic apoptosis. The representative profibrotic 
      transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta downregulated the expression of miR-29c as 
      well as Fas receptor and conferred resistance to apoptosis. We also found that 
      introduction of miR-29c mimic abrogated these TGF-beta-induced phenotypes of Fas 
      repression and apoptosis resistance. The results presented here suggest that 
      downregulation of miR-29 observed in IPF lungs may be associated with the 
      apoptosis-resistant phenotype of IPF lung fibroblasts via downregulation of Fas 
      receptor. Therefore, restoration of miR-29 expression in IPF lungs could not only 
      inhibit the accumulation of ECM but also normalize the sensitivity to apoptosis 
      in lung fibroblasts, which may be an effective strategy for treatment of IPF.

AB  - Both common and rare variants contribute to the genetic architecture of pulmonary 
      fibrosis. Genome-wide association studies have identified common variants, or 
      those with a minor allele frequency of >5%, that are linked to pulmonary 
      fibrosis. The most widely replicated variant (rs35705950) is located in the 
      promoter region of the MUC5B gene and has been strongly associated with 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and familial interstitial pneumonia (FIP) 
      across multiple different cohorts. However, many more common variants have been 
      identified with disease risk and in aggregate account for approximately one-third 
      of the risk of IPF. Moreover, several of these common variants appear to have 
      prognostic potential. Next generation sequencing technologies have facilitated 
      the identification of rare variants. Recent whole exome sequencing studies have 
      linked pathogenic rare variants in multiple new genes to FIP. Compared with 
      common variants, rare variants have lower population allele frequencies and 
      higher effect sizes. Pulmonary fibrosis rare variants genes can be subdivided 
      into two pathways: telomere maintenance and surfactant metabolism. Heterozygous 
      rare variants in telomere-related genes co-segregate with adult-onset pulmonary 
      fibrosis with incomplete penetrance, lead to reduced protein function, and are 
      associated with short telomere lengths. Despite poor genotype-phenotype 
      correlations, lung fibrosis associated with pathogenic rare variants in different 
      telomere genes is progressive and displays similar survival characteristics. In 
      contrast, many of the heterozygous rare variants in the surfactant genes predict 
      a gain of toxic function from protein misfolding and increased endoplasmic 
      reticulum (ER) stress. Evidence of both telomere shortening and increased ER 
      stress have been found in sporadic IPF patients, suggesting that the mechanisms 
      identified from rare variant genetic studies in unique individuals and families 
      are applicable to a wider spectrum of patients. The ability to sequence large 
      cohorts of individuals rapidly has the potential to further our understanding of 
      the relative contributions of common and rare variants in the pathogenesis of 
      pulmonary fibrosis. The UK 100,000 Genomes Project will provide opportunities to 
      interrogate both common and rare variants and to investigate how these biological 
      signals provide diagnostic and prognostic information in the era of stratified 
      medicine.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a form of progressive interstitial lung 
      disease with unknown etiology. Due to a lack of effective treatment, IPF is 
      associated with a high mortality rate. The hallmark feature of this disease is 
      the accumulation of activated myofibroblasts that excessively deposit 
      extracellular matrix proteins, thus compromising lung architecture and function 
      and hindering gas exchange. Here we investigated the origin of activated 
      myofibroblasts and the molecular mechanisms governing fibrosis formation and 
      resolution. Genetic engineering in mice enables the time-controlled labeling and 
      monitoring of lipogenic or myogenic populations of lung fibroblasts during 
      fibrosis formation and resolution. Our data demonstrate a lipogenic-to-myogenic 
      switch in fibroblastic phenotype during fibrosis formation. Conversely, we 
      observed a myogenic-to-lipogenic switch during fibrosis resolution. Analysis of 
      human lung tissues and primary human lung fibroblasts indicates that this fate 
      switching is involved in IPF pathogenesis, opening potential therapeutic avenues 
      to treat patients.

AB  - Aging is associated with impairments in homeostasis. Although aging and 
      senescence are not equivalent, the number of senescent cells increases with 
      aging. Cellular senescence plays important roles in tissue repair or remodeling, 
      as well as embryonic development. Autophagy is a process of lysosomal 
      self-degradation that maintains a homeostatic balance between the synthesis, 
      degradation, and recycling of cellular proteins. Autophagy diminishes with aging; 
      additionally, accelerated aging can be attributed to reduced autophagy. Cellular 
      senescence has been widely implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive 
      pulmonary disease (COPD), a disease of accelerated lung aging, presumably by 
      impairing cell repopulation and by aberrant cytokine secretion in the 
      senescence-associated secretory phenotype. The possible participation of 
      autophagy in the pathogenic sequence of COPD has been extensively explored. 
      Although it has been reported that increased autophagy may induce epithelial cell 
      death, an insufficient reserve of autophagy can induce cellular senescence in 
      bronchial epithelial cells of COPD. Furthermore, advanced age is one of the most 
      important risk factors for the development of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
      (IPF). Telomere shortening is found in blood leukocytes and alveolar epithelial 
      cells from patients with IPF. Accelerated senescence of epithelial cells plays a 
      role in IPF pathogenesis by perpetuating abnormal epithelial-mesenchymal 
      interactions. Insufficient autophagy may be an underlying mechanism of 
      accelerated epithelial cell senescence and myofibroblast differentiation in IPF. 
      Herein, we review the molecular mechanisms of cellular senescence and autophagy 
      and summarize the role of cellular senescence and autophagy in both COPD and IPF.

TI  - [miR-21 promotes pulmonary fibrosis in rats via down-regulating the expression of 
      ADAMTS-1].
PG  - 1636-1640
AB  - Objective To observe the effect of miR-21 on bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis 
      in rats, and explore the related mechanism. Methods Peripheral blood was 
      collected from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients (n=20) and healthy 
      adults (n=20). Fluorescence quantitative real-time PCR was then used to measure 
      miR-21 expression. Forty-five SD rats were randomly divided into control group, 
      miR-21 agomir group and miR-21 antagomir group. Each group included 15 rats. 
      After establishment of pulmonary fibrosis models by intratracheal administration 
      with bleomycin A5, rats in control group, miR-21 agomir group and miR-21 
      antagomir group were injected at caudal vein with normal saline, miR21 agomir and 
      miR21 antagomir, respectively. All rats were sacrificed on day 28 after modeling. 
      Subsequently, the pulmonary tissues were removed for HE and Masson staining. The 
      mRNA and protein expressions of a disintegrin-like and metalloproteinase with 
      thrombospondin type 1 motif (ADAMTS-1), collagen type 1 (Col1) and collagen type 
      3 (Col3) were detected by fluorescence quantitative real-time PCR and Western 
      blotting. Serum was separated to examine procollagen type 1 carboxyterminal 
      propeptide (P1CP) and procollagen type 3 aminoterminal propeptide (P3NP) 
      concentrations by ELISA. Results The level of miR-21 in peripheral blood was 
      higher in IPF patients than in healthy adults. The alveolitis and pulmonary 
      fibrosis extent in miR-21 agomir group was heavier than that in the control 
      group. However, the alveolitis and pulmonary fibrosis extent in miR-21 antagomir 
      group was improved when compared with the control group. In comparison with the 
      control group, ADAMTS-1 mRNA and protein expression was significantly 
      downregulated, whereas the mRNA and protein expressions of Col1 and Col3 were 
      significantly upregulated and serum P1CP and P3NP concentrations were elevated in 
      miR-21 agomir group. On the contrary, the level of ADAMTS-1 mRNA and protein 
      expression in miR-21 antagomir group was higher than that in the control group; 
      the levels of Col1 and Col3 mRNA and protein as well as serum P1CP and P3NP 
      concentrations in miR-21 antagomir group were lower than those in the control 
      group. Conclusion miR-21 promotes the progression of bleomycin-induced pulmonary 
      fibrosis in rats. The mechanism is associated with downregulation of ADAMTS-1 
      expression and subsequent increase of pulmonary Col1 and Col3 contents.

TI  - Effects and mechanisms of pirfenidone, prednisone and acetylcysteine on pulmonary 
      fibrosis in rat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis models.
PG  - 450-455
AB  - CONTEXT: Previous studies have reported that caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is associated 
      with lung fibrosis. However, the role of Cav-1 expression in pirfenidone-treated 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study 
      investigated Cav-1 expression in pirfenidone-treated IPF, and compared the 
      effects of pirfenidone with acetylcysteine and prednisone on IPF. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Rat IPF model was established by endotracheal injection of 5 mg/kg 
      bleomycin A5 into the specific pathogen-free Wistar male rats. Pirfenidone (P, 
      100 mg/kg once daily), prednisone (H, 5 mg/kg once daily) and acetylcysteine (N, 
      4 mg/kg 3 times per day) were used to treat the rat model by intragastric 
      administration for 45 consecutive days, respectively. The normal rats without IPF 
      were used as the controls. After 15, 30 and 45 days of drug treatment, lung 
      histopathology was assessed. The expression of Cav-1 was determined using 
      real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot; the expression of tumour necrosis 
      factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and platelet-derived 
      growth factor (PDGF) was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 
      RESULTS: After 15, 30 and 45 days of drug treatment, comparison of the three 
      drug-treated groups with the model group showed significantly lower (p < 0.05) 
      significance of airsacculitis and fibrosis scores of lung tissues, as well as 
      expression of TGF-beta1, TNF-alpha and PDGF, but the expression of Cav-1 was higher 
      (p < 0.05). Compared with the N group, the fibrosis score was significantly lower 
      and the protein expression of Cav-1 was significantly higher in the P group 
      (p < 0.05). Additionally, the expression of Cav-1 was negatively correlated with 
      the airsacculitis and fibrosis scores (r = -0.506, p < 0.01; r = -0.676, 
      p < 0.01) as well as expression of TGF-beta1, TNF-alpha and PDGF (r = -0.590, p < 0.01; 
      r = -0.530, p < 0.01; r = -0.553, p < 0.01). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: 
      Pirfenidone, prednisone and acetylcysteine can inhibit airsacculitis and 
      pulmonary fibrosis in rat IPF models, which may be related with enhanced 
      caveolin-1, reduced TNF-alpha, TGF-beta1, PDGF.

AB  - Maladaptive epithelial repair from chronic injury is a common feature in fibrotic 
      diseases, which in turn activates a pathogenic fibroblast response that produces 
      excessive matrix deposition. Dysregulated microRNAs (miRs) can regulate 
      expression of multiple genes and fundamentally alter cellular phenotypes during 
      fibrosis. Although several miRs have been shown to be associated with lung 
      fibrosis, the mechanisms by which miRs modulate epithelial behavior in lung 
      fibrosis are lacking. Here, we identified miR-323a-3p to be downregulated in the 
      epithelium of lungs with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) after lung 
      transplantation, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and murine 
      bleomycin-induced fibrosis. Antagomirs for miR-323a-3p augment, and mimics 
      suppress, murine lung fibrosis after bleomycin injury, indicating that this miR 
      may govern profibrotic signals. We demonstrate that miR-323a-3p attenuates TGF-alpha 
      and TGF-beta signaling by directly targeting key adaptors in these important 
      fibrogenic pathways. Moreover, miR-323a-3p lowers caspase-3 expression, thereby 
      limiting programmed cell death from inducers of apoptosis and ER stress. Finally, 
      we find that epithelial expression of miR-323a-3p modulates inhibitory crosstalk 
      with fibroblasts. These studies demonstrate that miR-323a-3p has a central role 
      in lung fibrosis that spans across murine and human disease, and downregulated 
      expression by the lung epithelium releases inhibition of various profibrotic 
      pathways to promote fibroproliferation.

TI  - Transcriptome of Cultured Lung Fibroblasts in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis: 
      Meta-Analysis of Publically Available Microarray Datasets Reveals Repression of 
      Inflammation and Immunity Pathways.
LID - 2091
AB  - Heritable profibrotic differentiation of lung fibroblasts is a key mechanism of 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Its mechanisms are yet to be fully 
      understood. In this study, individual data from four independent microarray 
      studies comparing the transcriptome of fibroblasts cultured in vitro from normal 
      (total n = 20) and IPF (total n = 20) human lung were compiled for meta-analysis 
      following normalization to z-scores. One hundred and thirteen transcripts were 
      upregulated and 115 were downregulated in IPF fibroblasts using the Significance 
      Analysis of Microrrays algorithm with a false discovery rate of 5%. Downregulated 
      genes were highly enriched for Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
      Genomes (KEGG) functional classes related to inflammation and immunity such as 
      Defense response to virus, Influenza A, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) mediated 
      signaling pathway, interferon-inducible absent in melanoma2 (AIM2) inflammasome 
      as well as Apoptosis. Although upregulated genes were not enriched for any 
      functional class, select factors known to play key roles in lung fibrogenesis 
      were overexpressed in IPF fibroblasts, most notably connective tissue growth 
      factor (CTGF) and serum response factor (SRF), supporting their role as drivers 
      of IPF. The full data table is available as a supplement.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive interstitial lung 
      disorder showcasing an interaction between genetic predisposition and 
      environmental risks. This usually involves the coaction of a mixture of cell 
      types associated with abnormal wound healing, leading to structural distortion 
      and loss of gas exchange function. IPF bears fatal prognosis due to respiratory 
      failure, revealing a median survival of approximately 2 to 3 years. This review 
      showcases the ongoing progress in understanding the complex pathophysiology of 
      IPF and it highlights the latest potential clinical treatments. In IPF, various 
      components of the immune system, particularly clotting cascade and shortened 
      telomeres, are highly involved in disease pathobiology and progression. This 
      review also illustrates two US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs, 
      nintedanib (OFEV, Boehringer Ingelheim, Ingelheim am Rhein, Germany) and 
      pirfenidone (Esbriet, Roche, Basel, Switzerland), that slow IPF progression, but 
      unfortunately neither drug can reverse the course of the disease. Although the 
      mechanisms underlying IPF remain poorly understood, this review unveils the past 
      and current advances that encourage the detection of new IPF pathogenic pathways 
      and the development of effective treatment methods for the near future.

AB  - Various pathophysiological conditions such as surfactant dysfunction, mechanical 
      ventilation, inflammation, pathogen products, environmental exposures, and 
      gastric acid aspiration stress lung cells, and the compromise of plasma membranes 
      occurs as a result. The mechanisms necessary for cells to repair plasma membrane 
      defects have been extensively investigated in the last two decades, and some of 
      these key repair mechanisms are also shown to occur following lung cell injury. 
      Because it was theorized that lung wounding and repair are involved in the 
      pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), in this review, we summarized the experimental evidence 
      of lung cell injury in these two devastating syndromes and discuss relevant 
      genetic, physical, and biological injury mechanisms, as well as mechanisms used 
      by lung cells for cell survival and membrane repair. Finally, we discuss relevant 
      signaling pathways that may be activated by chronic or repeated lung cell injury 
      as an extension of our cell injury and repair focus in this review. We hope that 
      a holistic view of injurious stimuli relevant for ARDS and IPF could lead to 
      updated experimental models. In addition, parallel discussion of membrane repair 
      mechanisms in lung cells and injury-activated signaling pathways would encourage 
      research to bridge gaps in current knowledge. Indeed, deep understanding of lung 
      cell wounding and repair, and discovery of relevant repair moieties for lung 
      cells, should inspire the development of new therapies that are likely preventive 
      and broadly effective for targeting injurious pulmonary diseases.

TI  - IDIOPATHIC PULMONARY FIBROSIS IS A COMPLEX GENETIC DISORDER.
PG  - 34-45
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a complex, heterogeneous genetic disorder 
      that is associated with rare and common sequence variants in many genes (MUC5B, 
      SFTPC, SFTPA2, RTEL1, TERT, and hTR), 11 novel loci, and multiple emerging 
      epigenetic and transcriptional profiles. In the past 5 years, we have found that: 
      1) genetic risk variants play major and similar roles in the development of both 
      familial and sporadic fibrotic idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, accounting for 
      up to 35% of the risk of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (a disease that was 
      previously thought to be idiopathic); 2) a promoter variant in MUC5B rs35705950 
      is the strongest risk factor for the development of IIP and IPF; however, 
      rs35705950 has a low penetrance; and 3) IPF is a complex genetic disease with 11 
      independent loci contributing to the development of this disease, pronounced 
      changes in DNA methylation, and transcriptional subtypes. In aggregate, these 
      findings suggest that IPF is a heterogeneous disease and that genetic and 
      molecular subtypes of IPF will provide essential clues to disease pathogenesis, 
      prognosis, treatment, and survival, all of which remain major problems in 
      understanding and treating patients with IPF. Although the basic biological 
      mechanisms involved in IPF are emerging, the disease is heterogeneous 
      pathologically and the final common pathways of fibrogenesis are not well 
      understood. These observations lead us to postulate that the etiology and 
      severity/extent of this complex condition will best be understood through an 
      integrated approach that accounts for inherited factors, epigenetic marks, and 
      dynamic changes in the transcriptome.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
      (COPD) are both debilitating lung diseases which can lead to hypoxemia and 
      pulmonary hypertension (PH). Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells (NFAT) is a 
      transcription factor implicated in the etiology of vascular remodeling in hypoxic 
      PH. We have previously shown that mice lacking the ability to generate Vasoactive 
      Intestinal Peptide (VIP) develop spontaneous PH, pulmonary arterial remodeling 
      and lung inflammation. Inhibition of NFAT attenuated PH in these mice suggesting 
      a connection between NFAT and VIP. To test the hypotheses that: 1) VIP inhibits 
      NFAT isoform c3 (NFATc3) activity in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells; 2) 
      lung NFATc3 activation is associated with disease severity in IPF and COPD 
      patients, and 3) VIP and NFATc3 expression correlate in lung tissue from IPF and 
      COPD patients. NFAT activity was determined in isolated pulmonary arteries from 
      NFAT-luciferase reporter mice. The % of nuclei with NFAT nuclear accumulation was 
      determined in primary human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell (PASMC) cultures; 
      in lung airway epithelia and smooth muscle and pulmonary endothelia and smooth 
      muscle from IPF and COPD patients; and in PASMC from mouse lung sections by 
      fluorescence microscopy. Both NFAT and VIP mRNA levels were measured in lungs 
      from IPF and COPD patients. Empirical strategies applied to test hypotheses 
      regarding VIP, NFATc3 expression and activity, and disease type and severity. 
      This study shows a significant negative correlation between NFAT isoform c3 
      protein expression levels in PASMC, activity of NFATc3 in pulmonary endothelial 
      cells, expression and activity of NFATc3 in bronchial epithelial cells and lung 
      function in IPF patients, supporting the concept that NFATc3 is activated in the 
      early stages of IPF. We further show that there is a significant positive 
      correlation between NFATc3 mRNA expression and VIP RNA expression only in lungs 
      from IPF patients. In addition, we found that VIP inhibits NFAT nuclear 
      translocation in primary human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC). 
      Early activation of NFATc3 in IPF patients may contribute to disease progression 
      and the increase in VIP expression could be a protective compensatory mechanism.

LID - 41770
AB  - The role of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) in idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF) remains unclear. uPA-generated plasmin has potent fibrogenic 
      actions involving protease activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). 
      Here we characterize uPA distribution or levels in lung tissue and sera from IPF 
      patients to establish the mechanism of its fibrogenic actions on lung fibroblasts 
      (LFs). uPA immunoreactivity was detected in regions of fibrosis including 
      fibroblasts of lung tissue from IPF patients (n = 7). Serum uPA levels and 
      activity were also higher in IPF patients (n = 18) than controls (n = 18) 
      (P < 0.05), being negatively correlated with lung function as measured by forced 
      vital capacity (FVC) %predicted (P < 0.05). The culture supernatants of LFs from 
      IPF patients, as compared to controls, showed an increase in plasmin activity 
      after plasminogen incubation (5-15 mug/mL), corresponding with increased levels of 
      uPA and IL-6 (n = 5-6, P < 0.05). Plasminogen-induced increases in plasmin 
      activity and IL-6 levels were attenuated by reducing uPA and/or PAR-1 expression 
      by RNAi. Plasmin(ogen)-induced mitogenesis was also attenuated by targeting uPA, 
      PAR-1 or IL-6. Our data shows uPA is formed in active regions of fibrosis in IPF 
      lung and contributes to LF plasmin generation, IL-6 production and proliferation. 
      Urokinase is a potential target for the treatment of lung fibrosis.

AB  - Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) regulates a variety of 
      biological processes. Nuclear translocation and activation of TAZ are regulated 
      by multiple mechanisms, including actin cytoskeleton and mechanical forces. TAZ 
      is involved in lung alveolarization during lung development and Taz-heterozygous 
      mice are resistant to bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. In this study, we explored 
      the roles of TAZ in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) 
      through histological analyses of human lung tissues and cell culture experiments. 
      TAZ was highly expressed in the fibroblastic foci of lungs from patients with 
      IPF. TAZ controlled myofibroblast marker expression, proliferation, migration, 
      and matrix contraction in cultured lung fibroblasts. Importantly, actin stress 
      fibers and nuclear accumulation of TAZ were more evident when cultured on a stiff 
      matrix, suggesting a feedback mechanism to accelerate fibrotic responses. Gene 
      expression profiling revealed TAZ-mediated regulation of connective tissue growth 
      factor (CTGF) and type I collagen. Clinical relevance of TAZ-regulated gene 
      signature was further assessed using publicly available transcriptome data. These 
      findings suggest that TAZ is involved in the pathogenesis of IPF through 
      multifaceted effects on lung fibroblasts.

TI  - A Novel Antifibrotic Mechanism of Nintedanib and Pirfenidone. Inhibition of 
      Collagen Fibril Assembly.
PG  - 77-90
LID - 10.1165/rcmb.2016-0217OC [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by excessive deposition of 
      extracellular matrix, in particular, collagens. Two IPF therapeutics, nintedanib 
      and pirfenidone, decelerate lung function decline, but their underlying 
      mechanisms of action are poorly understood. In this study, we sought to analyze 
      their effects on collagen synthesis and maturation at important regulatory 
      levels. Primary human fibroblasts from patients with IPF and healthy donors were 
      treated with nintedanib (0.01-1.0 muM) or pirfenidone (100-1,000 muM) in the 
      absence or presence of transforming growth factor-beta1. Effects on collagen, 
      fibronectin, FKBP10, and HSP47 expression, and collagen I and III secretion, were 
      analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. The 
      appearance of collagen fibrils was monitored by scanning electron microscopy, and 
      the kinetics of collagen fibril assembly was assessed using a light-scattering 
      approach. In IPF fibroblasts, nintedanib reduced the expression of collagen I and 
      V, fibronectin, and FKBP10 and attenuated the secretion of collagen I and III. 
      Pirfenidone also down-regulated collagen V but otherwise showed fewer and less 
      pronounced effects. By and large, the effects were similar in donor fibroblasts. 
      For both drugs, electron microscopy of IPF fibroblast cultures revealed fewer and 
      thinner collagen fibrils compared with untreated controls. Finally, both drugs 
      dose-dependently delayed fibril formation of purified collagen I. In summary, 
      both drugs act on important regulatory levels in collagen synthesis and 
      processing. Nintedanib was more effective in down-regulating profibrotic gene 
      expression and collagen secretion. Importantly, both drugs inhibited collagen I 
      fibril formation and caused a reduction in and an altered appearance of collagen 
      fibril bundles, representing a completely novel mechanism of action for both 
      drugs.

AB  - Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is commonly present in patients with chronic lung 
      diseases such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) or Idiopathic 
      Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) where it is classified as Group III PH by the World 
      Health Organization (WHO). PH has been identified to be present in as much as 40% 
      of patients with COPD or IPF and it is considered as one of the principal 
      predictors of mortality in patients with COPD or IPF. However, despite the 
      prevalence and fatal consequences of PH in the setting of chronic lung diseases, 
      there are limited therapies available for patients with Group III PH, with lung 
      transplantation remaining as the most viable option. This highlights our need to 
      enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to the 
      development of Group III PH. In this review we have chosen to focus on the 
      current understating of PH in IPF, we will revisit the main mediators that have 
      been shown to play a role in the development of the disease. We will also discuss 
      the experimental models available to study PH associated with lung fibrosis and 
      address the role of the right ventricle in IPF. Finally we will summarize the 
      current available treatment options for Group III PH outside of lung 
      transplantation.

TI  - miR-30a as Potential Therapeutics by Targeting TET1 through Regulation of Drp-1 
      Promoter Hydroxymethylation in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.
LID - 10.3390/ijms18030633 [doi]
LID - 633
AB  - Several recent studies have indicated that miR-30a plays critical roles in 
      various biological processes and diseases. However, the mechanism of miR-30a 
      participation in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) regulation is ambiguous. Our 
      previous study demonstrated that miR-30a may function as a novel therapeutic 
      target for lung fibrosis by blocking mitochondrial fission, which is dependent on 
      dynamin-related protein1 (Drp-1). However, the regulatory mechanism between 
      miR-30a and Drp-1 is yet to be investigated. Additionally, whether miR-30a can 
      act as a potential therapeutic has not been verified in vivo. In this study, the 
      miR-30a expression in IPF patients was evaluated. Computational analysis and a 
      dual-luciferase reporter assay system were used to identify the target gene of 
      miR-30a, and cell transfection was utilized to confirm this relationship. 
      Ten-eleven translocation 1 (TET1) was validated as a direct target of miR-30a, 
      and miR-30a mimic and inhibitor transfection significantly reduced and increased 
      the TET1 protein expression, respectively. Further experimentation verified that 
      the TET1 siRNA interference could inhibit Drp-1 promoter hydroxymethylation. 
      Finally, miR-30a agomir was designed and applied to identify and validate the 
      therapeutic effect of miR-30a in vivo. Our study demonstrated that miR-30a could 
      inhibit TET1 expression through base pairing with complementary sites in the 
      3'untranslated region to regulate Drp-1 promoter hydroxymethylation. Furthermore, 
      miR-30a could act as a potential therapeutic target for IPF.

TI  - XPLN is modulated by HDAC inhibitors and negatively regulates SPARC expression by 
      targeting mTORC2 in human lung fibroblasts.

AB  - Pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remains unclear. Secreted 
      protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) is a matricellular protein that 
      participates in the assembly and turnover of the extracellular matrix, whose 
      expression is regulated by transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 through activation 
      of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2). Exchange factor found in 
      platelets, leukemic, and neuronal tissues (XPLN) is an endogenous inhibitor of 
      mTORC2. However, whether XPLN modulates SPARC expression remains unknown. Herein, 
      we investigated the regulatory mechanisms of XPLN in human lung fibroblasts. 
      Effect of XPLN on mTORC2 activity was evaluated by silencing XPLN in human foetal 
      lung fibroblasts (HFL-1 cells), using small interfering RNA. SPARC expression was 
      quantified by quantitative real-time RT-PCR and western blotting. Fibroblasts 
      were treated with TGF-beta1, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, entinostat, or 
      vorinostat, to assess their effects on XPLN expression. Moreover, the effect of 
      mTORC1 inhibition on SPARC and XPLN was examined. XPLN depletion stimulated SPARC 
      expression and Akt phosphorylation on Ser473. TGF-beta1 treatment down-regulated 
      XPLN via Smad 2/3. XPLN mRNA expression was up-regulated upon treatment with HDAC 
      inhibitors in a concentration-dependent manner, and TGF-beta1-induced SPARC 
      expression was reversed by entinostat treatment. mTORC1 inhibition by rapamycin 
      and Raptor depletion stimulated SPARC expression. In conclusion, this is the 
      first study describing the involvement of XPLN in the regulation of SPARC. These 
      findings may help uncover the regulatory mechanisms of the mTORC2-SPARC axis. The 
      up-regulation of XPLN by HDAC inhibitors may be a novel therapeutic approach in 
      patients with IPF.

TI  - Cytokine modulation in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis undergoing 
      treatment with steroids, immunosuppressants, and IFN-gamma 1b.
PG  - 59-69
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disease of unknown etiology 
      and pathogenic mechanisms. From an etiopathogenic point of view, alveolar 
      macrophages play a key role in accumulation of fibroblasts and deposition of 
      collagen and extracellular matrix by releasing specific cytokines and 
      inflammatory mediators. IPF seems to be also associated with circulating 
      fibrocytes, which might be involved with an abnormal pulmonary vascular repair 
      and remodeling. Based on its hypothesized pathologic mechanisms, 
      anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and immunosuppressive therapies are often used. 
      For these reasons, Interferon-g (IFN-g) has been used to exploit its activity on 
      macrophages and fibroblasts. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
      response to corticosteroids and/or IFN-g 1b treatments based on pulmonary 
      function tests and on inflammatory cytokine patterns of expression on 
      bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), at baseline and during and after the therapies. 
      Unlike previous studies, we analyzed a period of therapy longer than 1 year. Our 
      results demonstrated the effectiveness of IFN-gamma in a group of IPF patients in 
      whom the treatment was prolonged for over a year. These data suggest a positive 
      role of IFN-gamma; treatment in patients in the initial stage of the disease.

TI  - Sirtuin 7 is decreased in pulmonary fibrosis and regulates the fibrotic phenotype 
      of lung fibroblasts.
PG  - L945-L958
LID - 10.1152/ajplung.00473.2016 [doi]
AB  - Pulmonary fibrosis is a severe condition with no cure and limited therapeutic 
      options. A better understanding of its pathophysiology is needed. Recent studies 
      have suggested that pulmonary fibrosis may be driven by accelerated aging-related 
      mechanisms. Sirtuins (SIRTs), particularly SIRT1, SIRT3, and SIRT6, are 
      well-known mediators of aging; however, limited data exist on the contribution of 
      sirtuins to lung fibrosis. We assessed the mRNA and protein levels of all seven 
      known sirtuins in primary lung fibroblasts from patients with idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung 
      disease (SSc-ILD) in comparison with lung fibroblasts from healthy controls. 
      These unbiased tests revealed a tendency for all sirtuins to be expressed at 
      lower levels in fibroblasts from patients compared with controls, but the 
      greatest decrease was observed with SIRT7. Similarly, SIRT7 was decreased in lung 
      tissues of bleomycin-challenged mice. Inhibition of SIRT7 with siRNA in cultured 
      lung fibroblasts resulted in an increase in collagen and alpha-smooth muscle actin 
      (alpha-SMA). Reciprocally, overexpression of SIRT7 resulted in lower basal and 
      TGF-beta-induced levels of COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, and alpha-SMA mRNAs, as well as 
      collagen and alpha-SMA proteins. Induced changes in SIRT7 had no effect on endogenous 
      TGF-beta mRNA levels or latent TGF-beta activation, but overexpression of SIRT7 reduced 
      the levels of Smad3 mRNA and protein. In conclusion, the decline in SIRT7 in lung 
      fibroblasts has a profibrotic effect, which is mediated by changes in Smad3 
      levels.

      fibrosis and the myofibroblast phenotype has prevented the development of 
      targeted therapies for IPF. Our previous study showed that isolated fibrogenic 
      lung fibroblasts have high endogenous levels of the hyaluronan receptor, CD44V6 
      (CD44 variant containing exon 6), which enhances the TGFbeta1 autocrine signaling 
      and induces fibroblasts to transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts. NADPH oxidase 
      4 (NOX4) enzyme, which catalyzes the reduction of O(2) to hydrogen peroxide 
      (H(2)O(2)), has been implicated in the cardiac and lung myofibroblast phenotype. 
      However, whether CD44V6 regulates NOX4 to mediate tissue repair and fibrogenesis 
      is not well-defined. The present study assessed the mechanism of how 
      TGF-beta-1-induced CD44V6 regulates the NOX4/reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling 
      that mediates the myofibroblast differentiation. Specifically, we found that 
      NOX4/ROS regulates hyaluronan synthesis and the transcription of CD44V6 via an 
      effect upon AP-1 activity. Further, CD44V6 is part of a positive-feedback loop 
      with TGFbeta1/TGFbetaRI signaling that acts to increase NOX4/ROS production, which is 
      required for myofibroblast differentiation, myofibroblast differentiation, 
      myofibroblast extracellular matrix production, myofibroblast invasion, and 
      myofibroblast contractility. Both NOX4 and CD44v6 are up-regulated in the lungs 
      of mice subjected to experimental lung injury and in cases of human IPF. Genetic 
      (CD44v6 shRNA) or a small molecule inhibitor (CD44v6 peptide) targeting of CD44v6 
      abrogates fibrogenesis in murine models of lung injury. These studies support a 
      function for CD44V6 in lung fibrosis and offer proof of concept for therapeutic 
      targeting of CD44V6 in lung fibrosis disorders.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease with few available 
      treatment options. Recently, the involvement of purinergic receptor subtypes in 
      the pathogenesis of different lung diseases has been demonstrated. Here we 
      investigated the role of the purinergic receptor subtype P2Y2 in the context of 
      fibrotic lung diseases.The concentration of different nucleotides was measured in 
      the broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid derived from IPF patients and animals 
      with bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. In addition expression of P2Y2 
      receptors by different cell types was determined. To investigate the functional 
      relevance of P2Y2 receptors for the pathogenesis of the disease the bleomycin 
      model of pulmonary fibrosis was used. Finally, experiments were performed in 
      pursuit of the involved mechanisms.Compared to healthy individuals or vehicle 
      treated animals, extracellular nucleotide levels in the BAL fluid were increased 
      in patients with IPF and in mice after bleomycin administration, paralleled by a 
      functional up-regulation of P2Y2R expression. Both bleomycin-induced inflammation 
      and fibrosis were reduced in P2Y2R-deficient compared to wild type animals. 
      Mechanistic studies demonstrated that recruitment of neutrophils into the lungs, 
      proliferation and migration of lung fibroblasts as well as IL6 production are key 
      P2Y2R mediated processes.Our results clearly demonstrate the involvement of P2Y2R 
      subtypes in the pathogenesis of fibrotic lung diseases in humans and mice and 
      hence support the development of selective P2Y2R antagonists for the treatment of 
      IPF.

AB  - Fibrotic diseases are not well-understood. They represent a number of different 
      diseases that are characterized by the development of severe organ fibrosis 
      without any obvious cause, such as the devastating diseases idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF) and scleroderma. These diseases have a poor prognosis comparable 
      with endstage cancer and are uncurable. Given the phenotypic differences, it was 
      assumed that the different fibrotic diseases also have different pathomechanisms. 
      Here, we demonstrate that many endstage fibrotic diseases, including IPF; 
      scleroderma; myelofibrosis; kidney-, pancreas-, and heart-fibrosis; and 
      nonalcoholic steatohepatosis converge in the activation of the AP1 transcription 
      factor c-JUN in the pathologic fibroblasts. Expression of the related AP1 
      transcription factor FRA2 was restricted to pulmonary artery hypertension. 
      Induction of c-Jun in mice was sufficient to induce severe fibrosis in multiple 
      organs and steatohepatosis, which was dependent on sustained c-Jun expression. 
      Single cell mass cytometry revealed that c-Jun activates multiple signaling 
      pathways in mice, including pAkt and CD47, which were also induced in human 
      disease. alphaCD47 antibody treatment and VEGF or PI3K inhibition reversed various 
      organ c-Jun-mediated fibroses in vivo. These data suggest that c-JUN is a central 
      molecular mediator of most fibrotic conditions.

LID - 10.1159/000475780 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a specific form of chronic, progressive 
      fibrosing interstitial pneumonia of unknown causes. Current diagnostic criteria 
      are based on radiological, clinical, and histopathological features but, 
      unfortunately, still many patients remain undiagnosed. Two currently approved 
      therapies, pirfenidone and nintedanib, slow down disease progression but failed 
      to block or revert it. On the other hand, many of the therapeutic agents tested 
      in several clinical trials have not given satisfactory answers, probably due to 
      the pathological heterogeneity of the disease. A growing number of studies show 
      that IPF phenotype is the common clinical outcome of a variety of different 
      pathophysiological mechanisms that identify disease subgroups characterised by 
      specific genetic and molecular biomarkers (endotypes). The precision medicine 
      approach is identifying and analysing the complex system of genetic, molecular, 
      environmental, and behavioural variables underlying the development of the 
      disease and the response to therapy. These molecular pathways are potential 
      targets for novel agents and useful diagnostic, prognostic, and theragnostic 
      biomarkers. We outline the status of knowledge in this field by discussing the 
      complex pathogenetic pathways underlying different disease subgroups and 
      assessing a stratification approach to novel therapeutic agents based on these 
      endotypes.

TI  - Pulmonary fibrosis requires cell-autonomous mesenchymal fibroblast growth factor 
      (FGF) signaling.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by progressive pulmonary 
      scarring, decline in lung function, and often results in death within 3-5 five 
      years after diagnosis. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling has been 
      implicated in the pathogenesis of IPF; however, the mechanism through which FGF 
      signaling contributes to pulmonary fibrosis remains unclear. We hypothesized that 
      FGF receptor (FGFR) signaling in fibroblasts is required for the fibrotic 
      response to bleomycin. To test this, mice with mesenchyme-specific 
      tamoxifen-inducible inactivation of FGF receptors 1, 2, and 3 (Col1alpha2-CreER; TCKO 
      mice) were lineage labeled and administered intratracheal bleomycin. Lungs were 
      collected for histologic analysis, whole lung RNA and protein, and dissociated 
      for flow cytometry and FACS. Bleomycin-treated Col1alpha2-CreER; TCKO mice have 
      decreased pulmonary fibrosis, collagen production, and fewer alpha-smooth muscle 
      actin-positive (alphaSMA+) myofibroblasts compared with controls. Freshly isolated 
      Col1alpha2-CreER; TCKO mesenchymal cells from bleomycin-treated mice have decreased 
      collagen expression compared with wild type mesenchymal cells. Furthermore, 
      lineage labeled FGFR-deficient fibroblasts have decreased enrichment in fibrotic 
      areas and decreased proliferation. These data identify a cell autonomous 
      requirement for mesenchymal FGFR signaling in the development of pulmonary 
      fibrosis, and for the enrichment of the Col1alpha2-CreER-positive (Col1alpha2+) 
      mesenchymal lineage in fibrotic tissue following bleomycin exposure. We conclude 
      that mesenchymal FGF signaling is required for the development of pulmonary 
      fibrosis, and that therapeutic strategies aimed directly at mesenchymal FGF 
      signaling could be beneficial in the treatment of IPF.

TI  - ICOS protects against mortality from acute lung injury through activation of 
      IL-5(+) ILC2s.

LID - 10.1038/mi.2017.42 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive lung disease causing 
      irreversible lung scarring and loss of pulmonary function. IPF Patients suffer 
      from a high rate of pulmonary infections and acute exacerbations of disease that 
      further contribute to pulmonary decline. Low expression of the inducible T-cell 
      costimulatory molecule (ICOS) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells predicts 
      decreased survival of IPF patients, but the mechanisms by which ICOS protects are 
      unclear. Using a model of bleomycin-induced lung injury and fibrosis, we now 
      demonstrate that ICOS expression enhances survival from lung injury rather than 
      regulating fibrogenesis. Of ICOS-expressing cells, type 2 innate lymphocytes 
      (ILC2s) are the first to respond to bleomycin-induced injury, and this expansion 
      is ICOS dependent. Interestingly, a similar decrease in ICOS(+) ILCs was found in 
      lung tissue from IPF patients. Interleukin (IL)-5, produced primarily by ILC2s, 
      was significantly reduced after lung injury in ICOS(-/-) mice, and strikingly, 
      treatment with IL-5 protected both ICOS(-/-) and wild-type mice from mortality. 
      These results imply that low ICOS expression and decreased lung ILC2s in IPF 
      patients may contribute to poor recovery from infections and acute exacerbation 
      and that IL-5 treatment may be a novel therapeutic strategy to overcome these 
      defects and protect against lung injury.

TI  - A systematic review of overlapping microRNA patterns in systemic sclerosis and 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
LID - 10.1183/16000617.0125-2016 [doi]
LID - 160125
AB  - Lung fibrosis can be observed in systemic sclerosis and in idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis, two disorders where lung involvement carries a poor prognosis. Although 
      much has been learned about the pathogenesis of these conditions, interventions 
      capable of reversing or, at the very least, halting disease progression are not 
      available. Recent studies point to the potential role of micro messenger RNAs 
      (microRNAs) in cancer and tissue fibrogenesis. MicroRNAs are short non-coding RNA 
      sequences (20-23 nucleotides) that are endogenous, evolutionarily conserved and 
      encoded in the genome. By acting on several genes, microRNAs control protein 
      expression. Considering the above, we engaged in a systematic review of the 
      literature in search of overlapping observations implicating microRNAs in the 
      pathogenesis of both idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and systemic sclerosis 
      (SSc). Our objective was to uncover top microRNA candidates for further 
      investigation based on their mechanisms of action and their potential for serving 
      as targets for intervention against lung fibrosis. Our review points to microRNAs 
      of the -29 family, -21-5p and -92a-3p, -26a-5p and let-7d-5p as having distinct 
      and counter-balancing actions related to lung fibrosis. Based on this, we 
      speculate that readjusting the disrupted balance between these microRNAs in lung 
      fibrosis related to SSc and IPF may have therapeutic potential.

TI  - Exposure to febrile-range hyperthermia potentiates Wnt signalling and 
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition gene expression in lung epithelium.
PG  - 1-10
LID - 10.1080/02656736.2017.1316875 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As environmental and body temperatures vary, lung epithelial cells 
      experience temperatures significantly different from normal core temperature. Our 
      previous studies in human lung epithelium showed that: (i) heat shock accelerates 
      wound healing and activates profibrotic gene expression through heat shock 
      factor-1 (HSF1); (ii) HSF1 is activated at febrile temperatures (38-41  degrees C) and 
      (iii) hypothermia (32  degrees C) activates and hyperthermia (39.5  degrees C) reduces expression 
      of a subset of miRNAs that target protein kinase-Calpha (PKCalpha) and enhance 
      proliferation. METHODS: We analysed the effect of hypo- and hyperthermia exposure 
      on Wnt signalling by exposing human small airway epithelial cells (SAECs) and 
      HEK293T cells to 32, 37 or 39.5  degrees C for 24 h, then analysing Wnt-3a-induced 
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) gene expression by qRT-PCR and TOPFlash 
      reporter plasmid activity. Effects of miRNA mimics and inhibitors and the HSF1 
      inhibitor, KNK437, were evaluated. RESULTS: Exposure to 39.5  degrees C for 24 h 
      increased subsequent Wnt-3a-induced EMT gene expression in SAECs and 
      Wnt-3a-induced TOPFlash activity in HEK293T cells. Increased Wnt responsiveness 
      was associated with HSF1 activation and blocked by KNK437. Overexpressing 
      temperature-responsive miRNA mimics reduced Wnt responsiveness in 39.5  degrees C-exposed 
      HEK293T cells, but inhibitors of the same miRNAs failed to restore Wnt 
      responsiveness in 32  degrees C-exposed HEK293T cells. CONCLUSIONS: Wnt responsiveness, 
      including expression of genes associated with EMT, increases after exposure to 
      febrile-range temperature through an HSF1-dependent mechanism that is independent 
      of previously identified temperature-dependent miRNAs. This process may be 
      relevant to febrile fibrosing lung diseases, including the fibroproliferative 
      phase of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and exacerbations of 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

TI  - Pirfenidone inhibits myofibroblast differentiation and lung fibrosis development 
      during insufficient mitophagy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pirfenidone (PFD) is an anti-fibrotic agent used to treat idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), but its precise mechanism of action remains elusive. 
      Accumulation of profibrotic myofibroblasts is a crucial process for fibrotic 
      remodeling in IPF. Recent findings show participation of autophagy/mitophagy, 
      part of the lysosomal degradation machinery, in IPF pathogenesis. Mitophagy has 
      been implicated in myofibroblast differentiation through regulating mitochondrial 
      reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated platelet-derived growth factor receptor 
      (PDGFR) activation. In this study, the effect of PFD on autophagy/mitophagy 
      activation in lung fibroblasts (LF) was evaluated, specifically the anti-fibrotic 
      property of PFD for modulation of myofibroblast differentiation during 
      insufficient mitophagy. METHODS: Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-induced or 
      ATG5, ATG7, and PARK2 knockdown-mediated myofibroblast differentiation in LF were 
      used for in vitro models. The anti-fibrotic role of PFD was examined in a 
      bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung fibrosis model using PARK2 knockout (KO) mice. 
      RESULTS: We found that PFD induced autophagy/mitophagy activation via enhanced 
      PARK2 expression, which was partly involved in the inhibition of myofibroblast 
      differentiation in the presence of TGF-beta. PFD inhibited the myofibroblast 
      differentiation induced by PARK2 knockdown by reducing mitochondrial ROS and 
      PDGFR-PI3K-Akt activation. BLM-treated PARK2 KO mice demonstrated augmentation of 
      lung fibrosis and oxidative modifications compared to those of BLM-treated wild 
      type mice, which were efficiently attenuated by PFD. CONCLUSIONS: These results 
      suggest that PFD induces PARK2-mediated mitophagy and also inhibits lung fibrosis 
      development in the setting of insufficient mitophagy, which may at least partly 
      explain the anti-fibrotic mechanisms of PFD for IPF treatment.

TI  - Transcriptome profiles in sarcoidosis and their potential role in disease 
      prediction.
PG  - 487-492
LID - 10.1097/MCP.0000000000000403 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease defined by the presence of 
      nonnecrotizing granuloma in the absence of any known cause. Although the 
      heterogeneity of sarcoidosis is well characterized clinically, the transcriptome 
      of sarcoidosis and underlying molecular mechanisms are not. The signal of all 
      transcripts, small and long noncoding RNAs, can be detected using microarrays or 
      RNA-Sequencing. Analyzing the transcriptome of tissues that are directly affected 
      by granulomas is of great importance to understand biology of the disease and may 
      be predictive of disease and treatment outcome. RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple genome 
      wide expression studies performed on sarcoidosis affected tissues were published 
      in the last 11 years. Published studies focused on differences in gene expression 
      between sarcoidosis vs. control tissues, stable vs. progressive sarcoidosis, as 
      well as sarcoidosis vs. other diseases. Strikingly, all these transcriptomics 
      data confirm the key role of TH1 immune response in sarcoidosis and particularly 
      of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and type I IFN-driven signaling pathways. SUMMARY: The 
      steps toward transcriptomics of sarcoidosis in precision medicine highlight the 
      potentials of this approach. Large prospective follow-up studies are required to 
      identify signatures predictive of disease progression and outcome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive lung disease 
      with a poor prognosis. Inflammatory cytokines play a significant role in IPF 
      pathology. However, the fibroblast itself is also believed to be the primary 
      effector in IPF. We hypothesized that the fibroblasts themselves secrete 
      pro-inflammatory cytokines that could propagate IPF by affecting normal 
      neighboring cells. Thus, we explored the effects of IPF fibroblast derived media 
      on normal fibroblast characteristics. METHODS: Primary IPF/normal tissue derived 
      fibroblast cultures were established and their supernatants were collected 
      (IPF/N-SN, respectively). These supernatants were added to normal fibroblasts. 
      Cell death (caspase-3, western blot), proliferation, viability (WST-1), migration 
      (scratch test) and cell detachment (crystal violet and fibronectin adhesion 
      assays) were tested. 10 inflammatory cytokines were measured by ELISA-based 
      quantitative array. Integrin alpha5 (ITGA5), pIkappaBalpha, p/total STAT3 levels were 
      measured by western blot/IHC. TNF-alpha involvement was confirmed using Infliximab (R), 
      anti-TNF-alpha mAb. RESULTS: The IPF-SN facilitated fibroblast cell detachment and 
      reduced cell migration (p < 0.05). Nevertheless, these effects were reversed when 
      cells were seeded on fibronectin. The exposure to the IPF-SN also elevated ITGA5 
      levels, the fibronectin receptor, in addition to NFkappaB pathway activation (pIkappaBalpha upward arrow 
      150%, p < 0.05). In accordance, IPF derived fibroblasts were found to express 
      higher ITGA5 than the normal cells (44% upward arrow, p < 0.05). ITGA5 was also expressed in 
      the fibroblastic foci. The IPF-SN contained high TNF-alpha levels (3-fold, p < 0.05), 
      and Infliximab pretreatment successfully reversed all the above observations. 
      CONCLUSION: We suggest a possible mechanism in which IPF fibroblast secreted 
      TNF-alpha modifies neighboring fibroblast cell behavior.

AB  - Pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive lung disease that its pathogenic mechanism 
      currently is incompletely understood. Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling has 
      recently been identified as a regulator of inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis. 
      In addition, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) of different origins offer a great 
      promise in treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However mechanisms 
      of pathogenic roles of TLR signaling and therapeutic effects of MSCs in the IPF 
      remain elusive. In present study, the involvement of TLR signaling and the 
      therapeutic role of MSCs were interrogated in MyD88-deficient mice using human 
      placental MSCs of fetal origins (hfPMSCs). The results showed an alleviated 
      pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in myeloid differentiation primary response 
      gene 88 (MyD88)-deficient mice treated with bleomycin (BLM), accompanied with a 
      reduced TGF-beta signaling and production of pro-fibrotic cytokines, including 
      TNF-alpha, IL-1beta. An exposure of HLF1 lung fibroblasts, A549 epithelial cells and 
      RAW264.7 macrophages to BLM led an increased expression of key components of 
      MyD88 and TGF-beta signaling cascades. Of interest, enforced expression and 
      inhibition of MyD88 protein resulted in an enhanced and a reduced TGF-beta signaling 
      in above cells in the presence of BLM, respectively. However, the addition of 
      TGF-beta1 showed a marginally inhibitory effect on MyD88 signaling in these cells in 
      the absence of BLM. Importantly, the administration of hfPMSCs could 
      significantly attenuate BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice, along with a 
      reduced hydroxyproline (HYP) deposition, MyD88 and TGF-beta signaling activation, 
      and production of pro-fibrotic cytokines. These results may suggest an importance 
      of MyD88/TGF-beta signaling axis in the tissue homeostasis and functional integrity 
      of lung in response to injury, which may offer a novel target for treatment of 
      pulmonary fibrosis.

TI  - The instructive extracellular matrix of the lung: basic composition and 
      alterations in chronic lung disease.
LID - 1601805 [pii]

AB  - The pulmonary extracellular matrix (ECM) determines the tissue architecture of 
      the lung, and provides mechanical stability and elastic recoil, which are 
      essential for physiological lung function. Biochemical and biomechanical signals 
      initiated by the ECM direct cellular function and differentiation, and thus play 
      a decisive role in lung development, tissue remodelling processes and maintenance 
      of adult homeostasis. Recent proteomic studies have demonstrated that at least 
      150 different ECM proteins, glycosaminoglycans and modifying enzymes are 
      expressed in the lung, and these assemble into intricate composite biomaterials. 
      These highly insoluble assemblies of interacting ECM proteins and their glycan 
      modifications can act as a solid phase-binding interface for hundreds of secreted 
      proteins, which creates an information-rich signalling template for cell function 
      and differentiation. Dynamic changes within the ECM that occur upon injury or 
      with ageing are associated with several chronic lung diseases. In this review, we 
      summarise the available data about the structure and function of the pulmonary 
      ECM, and highlight changes that occur in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), 
      pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
      (COPD), asthma and lung cancer. We discuss potential mechanisms of ECM 
      remodelling and modification, which we believe are relevant for future diagnosis 
      and treatment of chronic lung disease.

TI  - Inhibition of hyaluronan synthesis attenuates pulmonary hypertension associated 
      with lung fibrosis.
PG  - 3284-3301
LID - 10.1111/bph.13947 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Group III pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a highly lethal 
      and widespread lung disorder that is a common complication in idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) where it is considered to be the single most significant 
      predictor of mortality. While increased levels of hyaluronan have been observed 
      in IPF patients, hyaluronan-mediated vascular remodelling and the 
      hyaluronan-mediated mechanisms promoting PH associated with IPF are not fully 
      understood. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Explanted lung tissue from patients with IPF 
      with and without a diagnosis of PH was used to identify increased levels of 
      hyaluronan. In addition, an experimental model of lung fibrosis and PH was used 
      to test the capacity of 4-methylumbeliferone (4MU), a hyaluronan synthase 
      inhibitor to attenuate PH. Human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC) 
      were used to identify the hyaluronan-specific mechanisms that lead to the 
      development of PH associated with lung fibrosis. KEY RESULTS: In patients with 
      IPF and PH, increased levels of hyaluronan and expression of hyaluronan synthase 
      genes are present. Interestingly, we also report increased levels of 
      hyaluronidases in patients with IPF and IPF with PH. Remarkably, our data also 
      show that 4MU is able to inhibit PH in our model either prophylactically or 
      therapeutically, without affecting fibrosis. Studies to determine the 
      hyaluronan-specific mechanisms revealed that hyaluronan fragments result in 
      increased PASMC stiffness and proliferation but reduced cell motility in a 
      RhoA-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Taken together, our results 
      show evidence of a unique mechanism contributing to PH in the context of lung 
      fibrosis.

TI  - Serpine 1 induces alveolar type II cell senescence through activating p53-p21-Rb 
      pathway in fibrotic lung disease.
PG  - 1114-1124
LID - 10.1111/acel.12643 [doi]
AB  - Senescence of alveolar type 2 (ATII) cells, progenitors of the alveolar 
      epithelium, is implicated in the pathogeneses of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
      (IPF), an aging-related progressive fatal lung disorder with unknown etiology. 
      The mechanism underlying ATII cell senescence in fibrotic lung diseases, however, 
      remains poorly understood. In this study, we report that ATII cells in IPF lungs 
      express higher levels of serpine 1, also known as plasminogen activator inhibitor 
      1 (PAI-1), and cell senescence markers p21 and p16, compared to ATII cells in 
      control lungs. Silencing PAI-1 or inhibition of PAI-1 activity in cultured rat 
      ATII (L2) cells leads to decreases in p53 serine 18 phosphorylation (p53(S18P) ), 
      p53 and p21 protein expressions; an increase in retinoblastoma protein 
      phosphorylation (ppRb); and a reduction in the sensitivity to bleomycin- and 
      doxorubicin-induced senescence. Silencing p53, on the other hand, abrogates PAI-1 
      protein-stimulated p21 expression and cell senescence. In vivo studies, using 
      ATII cell-specific PAI-1 conditional knockout mouse model generated recently in 
      this laboratory, further support the role of PAI-1 in the activation of 
      p53-p21-Rb cell cycle repression pathway, ATII cell senescence, and lung fibrosis 
      induced by bleomycin. This study reveals a novel function of PAI-1 in regulation 
      of cell cycle and suggests that elevation of PAI-1 contributes importantly to 
      ATII cell senescence in fibrotic lung diseases.

AB  - Aberrant proliferation and activation of lung fibroblasts contribute to the 
      initiation and progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, the 
      mechanisms responsible for the proliferation and activation of fibroblasts are 
      not fully understood. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of 
      miR-101 in the proliferation and activation of lung fibroblasts. miR-101 
      expression was determined in lung tissues from patients with IPF and mice with 
      bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. The regulation of miR-101 and cellular 
      signaling was investigated in pulmonary fibroblasts in vitro The role of miR-101 
      in pulmonary fibrosis in vivo was studied using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer 
      in mice. The expression of miR-101 was down-regulated in fibrotic lungs from 
      patients with IPF and bleomycin-treated mice. The down-regulation of miR-101 
      occurred via the E26 transformation-specific (ETS) transcription factor. miR-101 
      suppressed the WNT5a-induced proliferation of lung fibroblasts by inhibiting 
      NFATc2 signaling via targeting Frizzled receptor 4/6 and the TGF-beta-induced 
      activation of lung fibroblasts by inhibition of SMAD2/3 signaling via targeting 
      the TGF-beta receptor 1. Adenovirus-mediated miR-101 gene transfer in the mouse lung 
      attenuated bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis and improved lung function. Our data 
      suggest that miR-101 is an anti-fibrotic microRNA and a potential therapeutic 
      target for pulmonary fibrosis.

TI  - Using omics approaches to understand pulmonary diseases.
PG  - 149
LID - 10.1186/s12931-017-0631-9 [doi]
LID - 149
AB  - Omics approaches are high-throughput unbiased technologies that provide snapshots 
      of various aspects of biological systems and include: 1) genomics, the measure of 
      DNA variation; 2) transcriptomics, the measure of RNA expression; 3) epigenomics, 
      the measure of DNA alterations not involving sequence variation that influence 
      RNA expression; 4) proteomics, the measure of protein expression or its chemical 
      modifications; and 5) metabolomics, the measure of metabolite levels. Our 
      understanding of pulmonary diseases has increased as a result of applying these 
      omics approaches to characterize patients, uncover mechanisms underlying drug 
      responsiveness, and identify effects of environmental exposures and 
      interventions. As more tissue- and cell-specific omics data is analyzed and 
      integrated for diverse patients under various conditions, there will be increased 
      identification of key mechanisms that underlie pulmonary biological processes, 
      disease endotypes, and novel therapeutics that are efficacious in select 
      individuals. We provide a synopsis of how omics approaches have advanced our 
      understanding of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute 
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and 
      pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and we highlight ongoing work that will 
      facilitate pulmonary disease precision medicine.

TI  - Senolytic drugs target alveolar epithelial cell function and attenuate 
      experimental lung fibrosis ex vivo.
LID - 10.1183/13993003.02367-2016 [doi]
LID - 1602367
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating lung disease with poor 
      prognosis and limited therapeutic options. The incidence of IPF increases with 
      age, and ageing-related mechanisms such as cellular senescence have been proposed 
      as pathogenic drivers. The lung alveolar epithelium represents a major site of 
      tissue injury in IPF and senescence of this cell population is probably 
      detrimental to lung repair. However, the potential pathomechanisms of alveolar 
      epithelial cell senescence and the impact of senolytic drugs on senescent lung 
      cells and fibrosis remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that lung epithelial cells 
      exhibit increased P16 and P21 expression as well as senescence-associated 
      beta-galactosidase activity in experimental and human lung fibrosis tissue and 
      primary cells.Primary fibrotic mouse alveolar epithelial type (AT)II cells 
      secreted increased amounts of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) 
      factors in vitro, as analysed using quantitative PCR, mass spectrometry and 
      ELISA. Importantly, pharmacological clearance of senescent cells by induction of 
      apoptosis in fibrotic ATII cells or ex vivo three-dimensional lung tissue 
      cultures reduced SASP factors and extracellular matrix markers, while increasing 
      alveolar epithelial markers.These data indicate that alveolar epithelial cell 
      senescence contributes to lung fibrosis development and that senolytic drugs may 
      be a viable therapeutic option for IPF.

TI  - Olodaterol shows anti-fibrotic efficacy in in vitro and in vivo models of 
      pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 3848-3864
LID - 10.1111/bph.13982 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal 
      respiratory disease characterized by excessive fibroblast activation ultimately 
      leading to scarring of the lungs. Although, the activation of beta(2) -adrenoceptors 
      (beta(2) -AR) has been shown to inhibit pro-fibrotic events primarily in cell lines, 
      the role of beta(2) -adrenoceptor agonists has not yet been fully characterized. The 
      aim of our study was to explore the anti-fibrotic activity of the long-acting 
      beta(2) -adrenoceptor agonist olodaterol in primary human lung fibroblasts (HLF) and 
      in murine models of pulmonary fibrosis. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We assessed the 
      activity of olodaterol to inhibit various pro-fibrotic mechanisms, induced by 
      different pro-fibrotic mediators, in primary HLF from control donors and patients 
      with IPF (IPF-LF). The in vivo anti-fibrotic activity of olodaterol, given once 
      daily by inhalation in either a preventive or therapeutic treatment regimen, was 
      explored in murine models of lung fibrosis induced by either bleomycin or the 
      overexpression of TGF-beta1. KEY RESULTS: In both HLF and IPF-LF, olodaterol 
      attenuated TGF-beta-induced expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin, fibronectin and 
      endothelin-1 (ET-1), FGF- and PDGF-induced motility and proliferation and 
      TGF-beta/ET-1-induced contraction. In vivo olodaterol significantly attenuated the 
      bleomycin-induced increase in lung weight, reduced bronchoalveolar lavage cell 
      counts and inhibited release of pro-fibrotic mediators (TGF-ss, MMP-9 and tissue 
      inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1). Forced vital capacity was increased only with 
      the preventive treatment regimen. In the TGF-beta-overexpressing model, olodaterol 
      additionally reduced the Col3A1 mRNA expression. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: 
      Olodaterol showed anti-fibrotic properties in primary HLF from control and IPF 
      patients and in murine models of lung fibrosis.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disease characterized by 
      cellular phenotype alterations and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins. 
      The alternative activation of macrophages in the lungs has been associated as a 
      major factor promoting pulmonary fibrosis, however the mechanisms underlying this 
      phenomenon are poorly understood. In the present study, we have defined a 
      molecular mechanism by which signals transmitted from the extracellular matrix 
      via the alpha4beta1 integrin lead to the activation of Rac2 which regulates alternative 
      macrophage differentiation, a signaling axis within the pulmonary macrophage 
      compartment required for bleomycin induced pulmonary fibrosis. Mice deficient in 
      Rac2 were protected against bleomycin-induced fibrosis and displayed diminished 
      collagen deposition in association with lower expression of alternatively 
      activated profibrotic macrophage markers. We have demonstrated a macrophage 
      autonomous process by which the injection of M2 and not M1 macrophages restored 
      the bleomycin induced pulmonary fibrosis susceptibility in Rac2-/- mice, 
      establishing a critical role for a macrophage Rac2 signaling axis in the 
      regulation of macrophage differentiation and lung fibrosis in vivo. We also 
      demonstrate that markers of alternative macrophage activation are increased in 
      patients with IPF. Taken together, these studies define an important role for an 
      integrin-driven Rac2 signaling axis in macrophages, and reveal that Rac2 
      activation is required for polarization of macrophages towards a profibrotic 
      phenotype and progression of pulmonary fibrosis in vivo.

      fibrosis.

AB  - Interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and complement (C') activation have each been implicated 
      in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We have reported that 
      IL-17A induces epithelial injury via TGF-beta in murine bronchiolitis obliterans; 
      that TGF-beta and the C' cascade present signaling interactions in mediating 
      epithelial injury; and that the blockade of C' receptors mitigates lung fibrosis. 
      In the present study, we investigated the role of IL-17A in regulating C' in lung 
      fibrosis. Microarray analyses of mRNA isolated from primary normal human small 
      airway epithelial cells indicated that IL-17A (100 ng/ml; 24 h; n = 5 donor 
      lungs) induces C' components (C' factor B, C3, and GPCR kinase isoform 5), 
      cytokines (IL8, -6, and -1B), and cytokine ligands (CXCL1, -2, -3, -5, -6, and 
      -16). IL-17A induces protein and mRNA regulation of C' components and the 
      synthesis of active C' 3a (C3a) in normal primary human alveolar type II 
      epithelial cells (AECs). Wild-type mice subjected to IL-17A neutralization and 
      IL-17A knockout (il17a(-/-) ) mice were protected against bleomycin 
      (BLEO)-induced fibrosis and collagen deposition. Further, BLEO-injured il17a(-/-) 
      mice had diminished levels of circulating Krebs Von Den Lungen 6 (alveolar 
      epithelial injury marker), local caspase-3/7, and local endoplasmic reticular 
      stress-related genes. BLEO-induced local C' activation [C3a, C5a, and terminal C' 
      complex (C5b-9)] was attenuated in il17a(-/-) mice, and IL-17A neutralization 
      prevented the loss of epithelial C' inhibitors (C' receptor-1 related isoform Y 
      and decay accelerating factor), and an increase in local TUNEL levels. 
      RNAi-mediated gene silencing of il17a in fibrotic mice arrested the progression 
      of lung fibrosis, attenuated cellular apoptosis (caspase-3/7) and lung deposition 
      of collagen and C' (C5b-9). Compared to normals, plasma from IPF patients showed 
      significantly higher hemolytic activity. Our findings demonstrate that limiting 
      complement activation by neutralizing IL-17A is a potential mechanism in 
      ameliorating lung fibrosis.-Cipolla, E., Fisher, A. J., Gu, H., Mickler, E. A.,

AB  - Interstitial lung disease (ILD) comprises a large number of chronic lung disease 
      characterized by varying degrees of inflammation and fibrosis. Mostly they are 
      idiopathic including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), which is a specific 
      disorder characterized by progressive fibrosis leading commonly to end-stage lung 
      disease, respiratory failure, and fatal outcome. IPF and many of these fibrotic 
      ILDs lack effective therapy despite recent approval of two drugs to slow 
      progression in certain IPF patients. Because there are no natural models for IPF, 
      the use of animal models that reproduce key known features of the disease is 
      warranted. Thus, different animal models have been developed to investigate key 
      mechanisms underlying pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis and identify potential 
      therapeutic targets for IPF. While no animal model can recapitulate all features 
      of human disease, several are available to address select features of IPF and 
      other fibrotic ILDs. Historically, among the first to be developed and used 
      widely is the bleomycin model, which is the best-characterized and currently most 
      extensively used animal model due to its ability to reproduce many aspects of IPF 
      and other fibrotic ILDs, good reproducibility, and ease of induction. Studies 
      using the bleomycin model have identified many of the cellular and molecular 
      mechanisms now recognized as being important in pathogenesis of IPF and other 
      fibrotic ILDs, as well as novel therapies for these diseases, including two 
      recent drugs approved for treatment of IPF. This chapter will describe commonly 
      used techniques for induction of the model by endotracheal administration of 
      bleomycin through surgical and nonsurgical (transoral instillation).

TI  - Deletion of c-FLIP from CD11b(hi) Macrophages Prevents Development of 
      Bleomycin-induced Lung Fibrosis.
PG  - 66-78
LID - 10.1165/rcmb.2017-0154OC [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive lung disease with complex 
      pathophysiology and fatal prognosis. Macrophages (MPhi) contribute to the 
      development of lung fibrosis; however, the underlying mechanisms and specific MPhi 
      subsets involved remain unclear. During lung injury, two subsets of lung MPhi 
      coexist: Siglec-F(hi) resident alveolar MPhi and a mixed population of CD11b(hi) MPhi 
      that primarily mature from immigrating monocytes. Using a novel inducible 
      transgenic system driven by a fragment of the human CD68 promoter, we targeted 
      deletion of the antiapoptotic protein cellular FADD-like IL-1beta-converting 
      enzyme-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) to CD11b(hi) MPhi. Upon loss of c-FLIP, 
      CD11b(hi) MPhi became susceptible to cell death. Using this system, we were able to 
      show that eliminating CD11b(hi) MPhi present 7-14 days after bleomycin injury was 
      sufficient to protect mice from fibrosis. RNA-seq analysis of lung MPhi present 
      during this time showed that CD11b(hi) MPhi, but not Siglec-F(hi) MPhi, expressed 
      high levels of profibrotic chemokines and growth factors. Human MPhi from patients 
      with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis expressed many of the same profibrotic 
      chemokines identified in murine CD11b(hi) MPhi. Elimination of monocyte-derived MPhi 
      may help in the treatment of fibrosis. We identify c-FLIP and the associated 
      extrinsic cell death program as a potential pathway through which these 
      profibrotic MPhi may be pharmacologically targeted.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fibrotic lung disease, but 
      the mechanisms driving progression remain incompletely defined. We previously 
      reported that the IPF lung harbors fibrogenic mesenchymal progenitor cells 
      (MPCs), which serve as a cell of origin for IPF fibroblasts. Proliferating IPF 
      MPCs are located at the periphery of fibroblastic foci in an active cellular 
      front at the interface between the myofibroblast-rich focus core and adjacent 
      normal alveolar structures. Among a large set of genes that distinguish IPF MPCs 
      from their control counterparts, we identified IL-8 as a candidate mediator of 
      IPF MPC fibrogenicity and driver of fibrotic progression. IPF MPCs and their 
      progeny displayed increased steady-state levels of IL-8 and its cognate receptor 
      CXCR1 and secreted more IL-8 than did controls. IL-8 functioned in an autocrine 
      manner promoting IPF MPC self-renewal and the proliferation and motility of IPF 
      MPC progeny. Secreted IL-8 also functioned in a paracrine manner stimulating 
      macrophage migration. Analysis of IPF lung tissue demonstrated codistribution of 
      IPF MPCs with activated macrophages in the active cellular front of the 
      fibroblastic focus. These findings indicate that IPF MPC-derived IL-8 is capable 
      of expanding the mesenchymal cell population and recruiting activated macrophages 
      cells to actively evolving fibrotic lesions.

TI  - Combination Therapy with Pirfenidone plus Prednisolone Ameliorates 
      Paraquat-Induced Pulmonary Fibrosis.
PG  - 134-142
LID - 10.1007/s10753-017-0671-9 [doi]
AB  - Pirfenidone is known to slow the decline in vital capacity and increase survival 
      in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Besides, administration of 
      glucocorticoids, e.g., prednisolone has been the conventional strategy to the 
      treatment of patients with this disease, although their efficacy is under debate. 
      Since multiple coactivated pathways are involved in the pathogenesis of IPF, 
      combination therapy is a foundation strategy to cover many more synergetic 
      mechanisms and increase response. The aim of the present study was to compare the 
      therapeutic efficacy of prednisolone plus pirfenidone with pirfenidone alone in 
      PQ-induced lung fibrosis. After development of PQ-induced lung fibrosis, 
      pirfenidone, prednisolone, and their combination were administered for 14 
      consecutive days. Lung pathological lesions, along with increased hydroxyproline 
      were determined in the paraquat group. Paraquat also caused oxidative stress and 
      increasing the proinflammatory and profibrotic gene expression. Pirfenidone 
      attenuated the PQ-induced pulmonary fibrosis from the analysis of antioxidant 
      enzymes but prednisolone had no such effect. Co-treatment with pirfenidone and 
      prednisolone suppressed lung hydroxyproline content, TGF-beta1, and TNF-alpha; however, 
      prednisolone alone could not suppress pulmonary fibrosis which was significantly 
      suppressed only by pirfenidone. Pirfenidone also suppressed the increase in MMP-2 
      and TIMP-1 induced by PQ. All of these effects were exaggerated when pirfenidone 
      coadministered with prednisolone. These findings suggest that pirfenidone exerts 
      its antifibrotic effect through regulation of hydroxyproline content, oxidative 
      stress and proinflammatory and profibrotic gene expression during the development 
      of PQ-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats and combination therapy with 
      prednisolone can represent more potent therapeutic effects.

AB  - Fibroblast is believed to be the primary effector in idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF), a progressive lung disorder characterized by aberrant tissue 
      remodeling and the formation of fibroblastic foci. Due to the complicated 
      etiology and mechanism, there are few effective drugs for this fatal disease. 
      Shikonin (SHI), which is the major ingredient isolated from the plant 
      Lithospermum Erythrorhizon, has long been used as traditional medicine for many 
      diseases including inflammation and cancer. The roles of SHI in attenuating skin 
      scar and renal fibrosis by reducing TGFbeta1-stimulated fibroblast activation are 
      also reported. But whether SHI works on IPF which exhibits both inflammatory and 
      carcinoma-like features remains unknown. In this study, using isolated pulmonary 
      fibroblasts, we demonstrated that SHI inhibited the proliferation, migration of 
      fibroblasts, enhanced cell apoptosis and led to cell cycle arrest at G1 and G2/M 
      phase. Moreover, SHI reduced the production of alpha-SMA, fibronectin, collagen I and 
      III in response to TGF-beta induction in pulmonary fibroblasts, and all of these 
      gene production is the key component of extracellular matrix for tissue 
      remodeling for IPF. The phosphorylation of Akt was down-regulated, p53 increased, 
      the mRNA levels of p21 and p27 enhanced after SHI treatments. The phosphorylation 
      of both p38 MAPK and Akt stimulated by TGF-beta was reduced after SHI treatments. 
      Collectively, these data indicate that SHI has a strong cytotoxicity in pulmonary 
      fibroblast via inhibiting Akt activation signaling pathway, and attenuates TGF-beta 
      induced extracellular matrix genes production in pulmonary fibroblasts via 
      modulating the activities of p38 MAPK and Akt. SHI might serve as a 
      therapeutically candidate for IPF patients.

AB  - Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a rare disease of the respiratory system 
      in which the lungs stiffen and get scarred, resulting in breathing weakness and 
      eventually leading to death. Drug repurposing is a process that provides evidence 
      for existing drugs that may also be effective in different diseases. In this 
      study, we present a computational pipeline having as input a number of gene 
      expression datasets from early and advanced stages of IPF and as output lists of 
      repurposed drugs ranked with a novel composite score. We have devised and used a 
      scoring formula in order to rank the repurposed drugs, consolidating the standard 
      repurposing score with structural, functional and side effects' scores for each 
      drug per stage of IPF. The whole pipeline involves the selection of proper gene 
      expression datasets, data preprocessing and statistical analysis, selection of 
      the most important genes related to the disease, analysis of biological pathways, 
      investigation of related molecular mechanisms, identification of fibrosis-related 
      microRNAs, drug repurposing, structural and literature-based analysis of the 
      repurposed drugs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive and 
      fatal disease. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) alters function and fate of various 
      proteins via deacetylation of lysine residues, and is implicated in 
      TGF-beta1-induced EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition). However, the role of 
      HDAC6 in pulmonary fibrosis is unknown. METHODS: HDAC6 expression in IPF and 
      control lungs was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and 
      immunoblots. Lung fibroblasts were treated with TGF-beta1 +/- HDAC6 inhibitors 
      (Tubacin, Tubastatin, ACY1215, or MC1568), and fibrotic markers such as type I 
      collagen were assessed using qRT-PCR and immunoblots. Mice were treated with 
      bleomycin (oropharyngeal aspiration; single dose) +/- Tubastatin (intraperitoneally 
      injection; daily for 21 days), and lung collagen expression was gauged using 
      immunoblots and trichrome staining. In a separate experiment, HDAC6 wild-type 
      (WT) and knockout (KO) mice were administered bleomycin, and lungs were evaluated 
      in the same manner. RESULTS: HDAC6 expression was deregulated in IPF lungs. Among 
      the HDAC6 inhibitors tested, only Tubastatin significantly repressed 
      TGF-beta1-induced expression of type-1 collagen in lung fibroblasts, and this 
      finding was coupled with decreased Akt phosphorylation and increased Akt-PHLPP 
      (PH domain and Leucine rich repeat Protein Phosphatase) association. Tubastatin 
      repressed TGF-beta1-induced S6K phosphorylation, HIF-1alpha expression, and VEGF 
      expression. Tubastatin also repressed TGF-beta1-induced inhibition of LC3B-II (a 
      marker of autophagosome formation). In bleomycin-treated mouse lungs, HDAC6 
      expression was increased, and Tubastatin repressed type-1 collagen expression. 
      However, in HDAC6 KO mice, bleomycin-induced type-1 collagen expression was not 
      repressed compared to WT mice. Knockdown of HDAC6, as well as HDAC10, another 
      potential Tubastatin target, did not inhibit TGF-beta1-induced collagen expression 
      in lung fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: HDAC6 expression is altered during lung 
      fibrogenesis. Tubastatin represses TGF-beta1-induced collagen expression, by 
      diminishing Akt phosphorylation and regulating downstream targets such as 
      HIF-1alpha-VEGF axis and autophagy. Tubastatin-treated WT mice are protected against 
      bleomycin-induced fibrosis, but HDAC6 KO mice are not. Our data suggest that 
      Tubastatin ameliorates pulmonary fibrosis, by targeting the TGFbeta-PI3K-Akt 
      pathway, likely via an HDAC6-independent mechanism.

TI  - Genetic variants associated with susceptibility to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
      in people of European ancestry: a genome-wide association study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive lung 
      disease with high mortality, uncertain cause, and few treatment options. Studies 
      have identified a significant genetic risk associated with the development of 
      IPF; however, mechanisms by which genetic risk factors promote IPF remain 
      unclear. We aimed to identify genetic variants associated with IPF susceptibility 
      and provide mechanistic insight using gene and protein expression analyses. 
      METHODS: We used a two-stage approach: a genome-wide association study in 
      patients with IPF of European ancestry recruited from nine different centres in 
      the UK and controls selected from UK Biobank (stage 1) matched for age, sex, and 
      smoking status; and a follow-up of associated genetic variants in independent 
      datasets of patients with IPF and controls from two independent US samples from 
      the Chicago consortium and the Colorado consortium (stage 2). We investigated the 
      effect of novel signals on gene expression in large transcriptomic and genomic 
      data resources, and examined expression using lung tissue samples from patients 
      with IPF and controls. FINDINGS: 602 patients with IPF and 3366 controls were 
      selected for stage 1. For stage 2, 2158 patients with IPF and 5195 controls were 
      selected. We identified a novel genome-wide significant signal of association 
      with IPF susceptibility near A-kinase anchoring protein 13 (AKAP13; rs62025270, 
      odds ratio [OR] 1.27 [95% CI 1.18-1.37], p=1.32 x 10(-9)) and confirmed 
      previously reported signals, including in mucin 5B (MUC5B; rs35705950, OR 2.89 
      [2.56-3.26], p=1.12 x 10(-66)) and desmoplakin (DSP; rs2076295, OR 1.44 
      [1.35-1.54], p=7.81 x 10(-28)). For rs62025270, the allele A associated with 
      increased susceptibility to IPF was also associated with increased expression of 
      AKAP13 mRNA in lung tissue from patients who had lung resection procedures 
      (n=1111). We showed that AKAP13 is expressed in the alveolar epithelium and 
      lymphoid follicles from patients with IPF, and AKAP13 mRNA expression was 
      1.42-times higher in lung tissue from patients with IPF (n=46) than that in lung 
      tissue from controls (n=51). INTERPRETATION: AKAP13 is a Rho guanine nucleotide 
      exchange factor regulating activation of RhoA, which is known to be involved in 
      profibrotic signalling pathways. The identification of AKAP13 as a susceptibility 
      gene for IPF increases the prospect of successfully targeting RhoA pathway 
      inhibitors in patients with IPF. FUNDING: UK Medical Research Council, National

AB  - Emerging evidence suggests that microRNA (miRNA) and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) 
      play important roles in disease development. However, the mechanism underlying 
      mRNA interaction with miRNA and lncRNA in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) 
      remains unknown. This study presents a novel lnc-PCF that promotes the 
      proliferation of TGF-beta1-activated epithelial cells through the regulation of 
      map3k11 by directly targeting miR-344a-5p during pulmonary fibrogenesis. 
      Bioinformatics and in vitro translation assay were performed to confirm whether 
      or not lnc-PCF is an actual lncRNA. RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) 
      and nucleocytoplasmic separation showed that lnc-PCF is mainly expressed in the 
      cytoplasm. Knockdown and knockin of lnc-PCF indicated that lnc-PCF could promote 
      fibrogenesis by regulating the proliferation of epithelial cells activated by 
      TGF-beta1 according to the results of xCELLigence real-time cell analysis system, 
      flow cytometry, and western blot analysis. Computational analysis and a 
      dual-luciferase reporter system were used to identify the target gene of 
      miR-344a-5p, whereas RNA pull down, anti-AGO2 RNA immunoprecipitation, and rescue 
      experiments were conducted to confirm the identity of this direct target. Further 
      experiments verified that lnc-PCF promotes the proliferation of activated 
      epithelial cells that were dependent on miR-344a-5p, which exerted its regulatory 
      functions through its target gene map3k11. Finally, adenovirus packaging 
      sh-lnc-PCF was sprayed into rat lung tissues to evaluate the therapeutic effect 
      of lnc-PCF. These findings revealed that lnc-PCF can accelerate pulmonary 
      fibrogenesis by directly targeting miR-344a-5p to regulate map3k11, which may be 
      a potential therapeutic target in IPF.

TI  - Lysyl oxidases regulate fibrillar collagen remodelling in idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis.
PG  - 1301-1312
LID - 10.1242/dmm.030114 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive scarring disease of the lung 
      with few effective therapeutic options. Structural remodelling of the 
      extracellular matrix [i.e. collagen cross-linking mediated by the lysyl oxidase 
      (LO) family of enzymes (LOX, LOXL1-4)] might contribute to disease pathogenesis 
      and represent a therapeutic target. This study aimed to further our understanding 
      of the mechanisms by which LO inhibitors might improve lung fibrosis. Lung 
      tissues from IPF and non-IPF subjects were examined for collagen structure 
      (second harmonic generation imaging) and LO gene (microarray analysis) and 
      protein (immunohistochemistry and western blotting) levels. Functional effects 
      (collagen structure and tissue stiffness using atomic force microscopy) of LO 
      inhibitors on collagen remodelling were examined in two models, collagen 
      hydrogels and decellularized human lung matrices. LOXL1/LOXL2 gene expression and 
      protein levels were increased in IPF versus non-IPF. Increased collagen fibril 
      thickness in IPF versus non-IPF lung tissues correlated with increased 
      LOXL1/LOXL2, and decreased LOX, protein expression. beta-Aminoproprionitrile (beta-APN; 
      pan-LO inhibitor) but not Compound A (LOXL2-specific inhibitor) interfered with 
      transforming growth factor-beta-induced collagen remodelling in both models. The 
      beta-APN treatment group was tested further, and beta-APN was found to interfere with 
      stiffening in the decellularized matrix model. LOXL1 activity might drive 
      collagen remodelling in IPF lungs. The interrelationship between collagen 
      structural remodelling and LOs is disrupted in IPF lungs. Inhibition of LO 
      activity alleviates fibrosis by limiting fibrillar collagen cross-linking, 
      thereby potentially impeding the formation of a pathological microenvironment in 
      IPF.

PG  - 221-232
LID - 10.1080/15548627.2017.1389823 [doi]
AB  - Persistent inflammation within the respiratory tract underlies the pathogenesis 
      of numerous chronic pulmonary diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary 
      disease, asthma and pulmonary fibrosis. Chronic inflammation in the lung may 
      arise from a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental influences, 
      including exposure to microbes, particles from the atmosphere, irritants, 
      pollutants, allergens, and toxic molecules. To this end, an immediate, strong, 
      and highly regulated inflammatory defense mechanism is needed for the successful 
      maintenance of homeostasis within the respiratory system. 
      Macroautophagy/autophagy plays an essential role in the inflammatory response of 
      the lung to infection and stress. At baseline, autophagy may be critical for 
      inhibiting spontaneous pulmonary inflammation and fundamental for the response of 
      pulmonary leukocytes to infection; however, when not regulated, persistent or 
      inefficient autophagy may be detrimental to lung epithelial cells, promoting lung 
      injury. This perspective will discuss the role of autophagy in driving and 
      regulating inflammatory responses of the lung in chronic lung diseases with a 
      focus on potential avenues for therapeutic targeting. Abbreviations AR allergic

AB  - Dry cough is a common symptom described in patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary 
      Fibrosis (IPF) and impairs quality of life. The exact mechanisms causing cough in 
      IPF remain unclear, however evidence suggests altered cough neurophysiology and 
      sensitisation plays a role; IPF patients have an enhanced cough reflex 
      sensitivity to inhaled capsaicin. The Transient Receptor Potential Vanniloid-1 
      channel (TRPV-1) has a role in the cough reflex and airway expression is 
      increased in patients with chronic cough. The Ankyrin-1 receptor (TRPA-1) is 
      often co-expressed. It was hypothesised that, like chronic cough patients, IPF 
      patients have increased airway TRP receptor expression. Bronchial biopsies were 
      obtained from 16 patients with IPF, 11 patients with idiopathic chronic cough and 
      8 controls without cough. All other causes of cough were rigorously excluded. 
      Real-time quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction was used to detect TRPV-1 and 
      TRPA-1 mRNA expression with Immunohistochemistry demonstrating protein 
      expression. Mean TRPV-1 and TRPA-1 gene expression was higher in IPF patients 
      compared with controls, but the difference did not reach statistical 
      significance. Immunostaining supported these findings. This study suggests that 
      structural up-regulation of central airway TRP receptors is not the key mechanism 
      for cough in IPF patients. It is probable that IPF cough results from altered 
      neuronal sensitivity at multiple levels of the cough pathway.

TI  - Protein Folding and the Challenges of Maintaining Endoplasmic Reticulum 
      Proteostasis in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.

AB  - Alveolar epithelial type II (AEII) cells are "professional" secretory cells that 
      synthesize and secrete massive quantities of proteins to produce pulmonary 
      surfactant and maintain airway immune defenses. To facilitate this high level of 
      protein synthesis, AEII cells are equipped with an elaborate endoplasmic 
      reticulum (ER) structure and possess an abundance of the machinery needed to 
      fold, assemble, and secrete proteins. However, conditions that suddenly increase 
      the quantity of new proteins entering the ER or that impede the capacity of the 
      ER to fold proteins can cause misfolded or unfolded proteins to accumulate in the 
      ER lumen, also called ER stress. To minimize this stress, AEII cells adapt by (1) 
      reducing the quantity of proteins entering the ER, (2) increasing the amount of 
      protein-folding machinery, and (3) removing misfolded proteins when they 
      accumulate. Although these adaptive responses, aptly named the unfolded protein 
      response, are usually effective in reducing ER stress, chronic aggregation of 
      misfolded proteins is recognized as a hallmark feature of AEII cells in patients 
      with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Although mutations in surfactant 
      proteins are linked to the development of ER stress in some rare IPF cases, the 
      mechanisms causing protein misfolding in most cases are unknown. In this article, 
      we review the mechanisms regulating ER proteostasis and highlight specific 
      aspects of protein folding and the unfolded protein response that are most 
      vulnerable to failure. Then, we postulate mechanisms other than genetic mutations 
      that might contribute to protein aggregation in the alveolar epithelium of IPF 
      lung.

TI  - Regulation of TERRA on telomeric and mitochondrial functions in IPF pathogenesis.
PG  - 163
LID - 10.1186/s12890-017-0516-1 [doi]
LID - 163
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aging is a known risk factor of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). 
      However, the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the effects of advanced aging 
      remain largely unknown. Telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) represents a type 
      of long noncoding RNA. In this study, the regulatory roles of TERRA on human 
      telomeres and mitochondria and IPF epithelial injury model were identified. 
      METHODS: Blood samples were collected from patients with IPF (n = 24) and matched 
      control individuals (n = 24). The significance of clinical research on the TERRA 
      expression correlated with pulmonary fibrosis was assessed. The expression levels 
      of TERRA in vivo and in vitro were determined through quantitative real-time 
      polymerase chain reaction analysis. Telomerase activity was observed using a 
      fluorescent quantitative TRAP assay kit. The functions of telomeres, 
      mitochondria, and associated genes were analyzed through RNA interference on 
      TERRA. RESULTS: TERRA expression levels significantly increased in the peripheral 
      blood mononuclear cells of IPF patients. The expression levels also exhibited a 
      direct and significantly inverse correlation with the percentage of predicted 
      force vital capacity, which is a physiological indicator of fibrogenesis during 
      IPF progression. This finding was confirmed in the epithelial injury model of IPF 
      in vitro. RNA interference on TERRA expression can ameliorate the functions of 
      telomeres; mitochondria; associated genes; components associated with telomeres, 
      such as telomerase reverse transcriptase, telomerase, and cell nuclear antigen, 
      cyclin D1; and mitochondria-associated cyclin E genes, including the MMP and 
      Bcl-2 family. The RNA interference on TERRA expression can also improve the 
      functions of oxidative-stress-associated genes, such as reactive oxygen species, 
      superoxide dismutase, and catalase, and apoptosis-related genes, such as 
      cytochrome c, caspase-9, and caspase-3. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the 
      regulation of TERRA expression on telomeres and mitochondria during IPF 
      pathogenesis was identified for the first time. The results may provide valuable 
      insights for the discovery of a novel biomarker or therapeutic approach for IPF 
      treatment.

AB  - Silicosis is an incurable and progressive lung disease characterized by chronic 
      inflammation and fibroblasts accumulation. Studies have indicated a vital role 
      for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in fibroblasts accumulation. NLRP3 
      inflammasome is a critical mediator of inflammation in response to a wide range 
      of stimuli (including silica particles), and plays an important role in many 
      respiratory diseases. However, whether NLRP3 inflammasome regulates 
      silica-induced EMT remains unknown. Our results showed that silica induced EMT in 
      human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE cells) in a dose- and time-dependent 
      manner. Meanwhile, silica persistently activated NLRP3 inflammasome as indicated 
      by continuously elevated extracellular levels of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and 
      IL-18. NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition by short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated 
      knockdown of NLRP3, selective inhibitor MCC950, and caspase-1 inhibitor 
      Z-YVAD-FMK attenuated silica-induced EMT. Western blot analysis indicated that 
      TAK1-MAPK-Snail/NF-kappaB pathway involved NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated EMT. Moreover, 
      pirfenidone, a commercially and clinically available drug approved for treating 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), effectively suppressed silica-induced EMT of 
      16HBE cells in line with NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition. Collectively, our results 
      indicate that NLRP3 inflammasome is a promising target for blocking or retarding 
      EMT-mediated fibrosis in pulmonary silicosis. On basis of this mechanism, 
      pirfenidone might be a potential drug for the treatment of silicosis.

AB  - Telomere maintenance dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of 
      Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). However, the mechanism of how telomere 
      length is related to fibrosis in the lungs is unknown. Surgical lung biopsies of 
      IPF patients typically show a heterogeneous pattern of non-fibrotic and fibrotic 
      areas. Therefore, telomere length (TL) in both lung areas of patients with IPF 
      and familial interstitial pneumonia was compared, specifically in alveolar type 2 
      (AT2) cells. Fluorescent in situ hybridization was used to determine TL in 
      non-fibrotic and fibrotic areas of 35 subjects. Monochrome multiplex quantitative 
      polymerase chain reaction (MMqPCR) was used for 51 whole lung biopsies and blood 
      TL measurements. For sporadic IPF subjects, AT2 cell TL in non-fibrotic areas was 
      56% longer than in fibrotic areas. No such difference was observed in the 
      surrounding lung cells. In subjects carrying a telomerase reverse transcriptase 
      (TERT) mutation, AT2 cell TL was significantly shorter than in sporadic subjects. 
      However, no difference in surrounding cell TL was observed between these subject 
      groups. Finally, using biopsy MMqPCR TL measurements, it was determined that IPF 
      subjects with shortest lung TL had a significantly worse survival than patients 
      with long TL. This study shows that shortening of telomeres critically affects 
      AT2 cells in fibrotic areas, implying TL as a cause of fibrogenesis. Furthermore, 
      short lung telomere length is associated with decreased survival.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, irreversible, and typically 
      fatal lung disease characterised by subpleural fibrosis, subepithelial fibroblast 
      foci, and microscopic honeycombing. Although understanding of the pathogenic 
      mechanisms continues to evolve, evidence indicates that distal airway and 
      alveolar epithelial cells are central drivers of the disease. In this Viewpoint, 
      we review the history of naming and classifications used to define the disease 
      now referred to as IPF, in the context of understanding the clinical 
      presentation, causes, and pathogenesis of the disease. We aim to generate 
      discussion on whether, given the substantial progress made in understanding the 
      clinical, genetic, cellular, and molecular mechanisms involved in the development 
      of IPF, a change of name should be considered. To initiate this discussion, we 
      offer new suggestions to update the name of this disease and new approaches to 
      classify all forms of pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - Remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is a common feature in lung diseases 
      such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF). Here, we applied a sequential tissue extraction strategy to 
      describe disease-specific remodeling of human lung tissue in disease, using 
      end-stages of COPD and IPF. Our strategy was based on quantitative comparison of 
      the disease proteomes, with specific focus on the matrisome, using 
      data-independent acquisition and targeted data analysis (SWATH-MS). Our work 
      provides an in-depth proteomic characterization of human lung tissue during 
      impaired tissue remodeling. In addition, we show important quantitative and 
      qualitative effects of the solubility of matrisome proteins. COPD was 
      characterized by a disease-specific increase in ECM regulators, metalloproteinase 
      inhibitor 3 (TIMP3) and matrix metalloproteinase 28 (MMP-28), whereas for IPF, 
      impairment in cell adhesion proteins, such as collagen VI and laminins, was most 
      prominent. For both diseases, we identified increased levels of proteins involved 
      in the regulation of endopeptidase activity, with several proteins belonging to 
      the serpin family. The established human lung quantitative proteome inventory and 
      the construction of a tissue-specific protein assay library provides a resource 
      for future quantitative proteomic analyses of human lung tissues. SIGNIFICANCE: 
      We present a sequential tissue extraction strategy to determine changes in 
      extractability of matrisome proteins in end-stage COPD and IPF compared to 
      healthy control tissue. Extensive quantitative analysis of the proteome changes 
      of the disease states revealed altered solubility of matrisome proteins involved 
      in ECM regulators and cell-ECM communication. The results highlight 
      disease-specific remodeling mechanisms associated with COPD and IPF.

AB  - Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disorder that is marked by 
      an over accumulation of activated fibroblast populations. Despite the improved 
      understanding of many mechanisms within this disease, global gene expression 
      analysis has few focused studies on the fibroblast, the central effector cell of 
      progressive fibrosis. We present a unique analysis of IPF pulmonary fibroblasts 
      as they transition through cell culture and identify in vitro altered cellular 
      processes. Fibroblasts were isolated from diseased (n = 8) and non-diseased 
      (n = 4) lungs. Global gene expression analysis was carried out at the initial 
      point of isolation and after 3 weeks of culture. We identify several genes that 
      are altered by removal of the fibroblast from the IPF environment. Comparison of 
      this subset of genes to four previously published whole lung analyses refined our 
      list to a small subset of key fibroblast specific genes important in IPF. 
      Application of STRING database analysis and confirmation via in-vitro and 
      histological assay highlights the CXCL14/CXCR4 chemokine axis with a possible 
      role in the progression and/or activation of fibroblasts within the IPF lung. Our 
      findings, present a possible therapeutic target for IPF and a model for the study 
      and discovery of novel protein and processes in this terrible disease.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive lung disease 
      characterized by epithelial cell activation, expansion of the fibroblast 
      population and excessive extracellular matrix accumulation. The mechanisms are 
      incompletely understood but evidence indicates that the deregulation of several 
      proteases contributes to its pathogenesis. Transmembrane protease serine 4 
      (TMPRSS4) is a novel type II transmembrane serine protease that may promote 
      migration and facilitate epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), two critical 
      processes in the pathogenesis of IPF. Thus, we hypothesized that over-expression 
      of TMPRSS4 in the lung could promote the initiation and/or progression of IPF. In 
      this study we first evaluated the expression and localization of TMPRSS4 in IPF 
      lungs by real time PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry. Then we examined 
      the lung fibrotic response in wild-type and TMPRSS4 deficient mice using the 
      bleomycin-induced lung injury model. We found that this protease is upregulated 
      in IPF lungs, where was primarily expressed by epithelial and mast cells. 
      Paralleling the findings in vivo, TMPRSS4 was expressed by alveolar and bronchial 
      epithelial cells in vitro and unexpectedly, provoked an increase of E-cadherin. 
      No expression was observed in normal human or IPF lung fibroblasts. The lung 
      fibrotic response evaluated at 28 days after bleomycin injury was markedly 
      attenuated in the haplodeficient and deficient TMPRSS4 mice. By morphology, a 
      significant reduction of the fibrotic index was observed in KO and heterozygous 
      mice which was confirmed by measurement of collagen content (hydroxyproline: WT: 
      164+/-21.1 mug/lung versus TMPRSS4 haploinsufficient: 110.2+/-14.3 mug/lung and TMPRSS4 
      deficient mice: 114.1+/-24.2 mug/lung (p<0.01). As in IPF, TMPRSS4 was also 
      expressed in epithelial and mast cells. These findings indicate that TMPRSS4 is 
      upregulated in IPF lungs and that may have a profibrotic role.

AB  - Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), with its main antifibrotic metabolite PGE(2), is 
      regarded as an antifibrotic gene. Repressed COX-2 expression and deficient PGE(2) 
      have been shown to contribute to the activation of lung fibroblasts and excessive 
      deposition of collagen in pulmonary fibrosis. We have previously demonstrated 
      that COX-2 expression in lung fibroblasts from patients with idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF) is epigenetically silenced and can be restored by epigenetic 
      inhibitors. This study aimed to investigate whether COX-2 downregulation induced 
      by the profibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) in normal lung 
      fibroblasts could be prevented by epigenetic inhibitors. We found that COX-2 
      protein expression and PGE(2) production were markedly reduced by TGF-beta1 and this 
      was prevented by the pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor suberanilohydroxamic acid 
      (SAHA) and to a lesser extent by the DNA demethylating agent Decitabine (DAC), 
      but not by the G9a histone methyltransferase (HMT) inhibitor BIX01294 or the EZH2 
      HMT inhibitor 3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNep). However, chromatin immunoprecipitation 
      assay revealed that the effect of SAHA was unlikely mediated by histone 
      modifications. Instead 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) luciferase reporter assay 
      indicated the involvement of post-transcriptional mechanisms. This was supported 
      by the downregulation by SAHA of the 3'-UTR mRNA binding protein TIA-1 (T-cell 
      intracellular antigen-1), a negative regulator of COX-2 translation. Furthermore, 
      TIA-1 knockdown by siRNA mimicked the effect of SAHA on COX-2 expression. These 
      findings suggest SAHA can prevent TGF-beta1-induced COX-2 repression in lung 
      fibroblasts post-transcriptionally through a novel TIA-1-dependent mechanism and 
      provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying its potential antifibrotic 
      activity.

TI  - miR-185 and miR-29a are similarly expressed in the bronchoalveolar lavage cells 
      in IPF and lung cancer but common targets DNMT1 and COL1A1 show disease specific 
      patterns.
PG  - 7105-7112

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and lung cancer (LC) constitute two 
      progressively devastating lung diseases with common risk factors including aging 
      and smoking. There is an increasing interest in the investigation of common 
      pathogenic mechanisms between IPF and LC with therapeutic implications. Several 
      oncomirs, microRNAs associated with malignancy, are also linked with IPF. miR‑29a 
      and miR‑185 downregulation is probably involved both in carcinogenesis and 
      fibrogenesis. We have previously observed miR‑29a and miR‑185 downregulation in 
      IPF cells from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and in this study we investigated 
      their expression in LC BAL cells. Common targets of miR‑29a and miR‑185 such as 
      DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)1, DNMT3b, COL1A1, AKT1 and AKT2 were measured. 
      Potential correlations with pulmonary function tests, smoking status and 
      endobronchial findings were investigated. Similar levels of miR‑29a and miR‑185 
      were detected in IPF and LC while their common targets AKT1 and DNMT3b were not 
      found to differ, suggesting potential pathogenetic similarities at the level of 
      key epigenetic regulators. By conrast, COL1A1 mRNA levels were increased in IPF 
      suggesting a disease‑specific mRNA signature. Notably, DNMT1 was downregulated in 
      the LC group and its expression was further reduced in the presence of increasing 
      malignant burden as it was implied by the endobronchial findings.

TI  - Dicer1 Deficiency in the Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Fibroblastic Focus 
      Promotes Fibrosis by Suppressing MicroRNA Biogenesis.
PG  - 486-496
LID - 10.1164/rccm.201709-1823OC [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: The lung extracellular matrix (ECM) in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
      (IPF) mediates progression of fibrosis by decreasing fibroblast expression of 
      miR-29 (microRNA-29), a master negative regulator of ECM production. The 
      molecular mechanism is undefined. IPF-ECM is stiffer than normal. Stiffness 
      drives fibroblast ECM production in a YAP (yes-associated protein)-dependent 
      manner, and YAP is a known regulator of miR-29. Therefore, we tested the 
      hypothesis that negative regulation of miR-29 by IPF-ECM was mediated by 
      mechanotransduction of stiffness. OBJECTIVES: To determine how IPF-ECM negatively 
      regulates miR-29. METHODS: We decellularized lung ECM using detergents and 
      prepared polyacrylamide hydrogels of defined stiffness by varying acrylamide 
      concentrations. Mechanistic studies were guided by immunohistochemistry of IPF 
      lung and used cell culture, RNA-binding protein assays, and xenograft models. 
      MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Contrary to our hypothesis, we excluded fibroblast 
      mechanotransduction of ECM stiffness as the primary mechanism deregulating 
      miR-29. Instead, systematic examination of miR-29 biogenesis revealed a microRNA 
      processing defect that impeded processing of miR-29 into its mature bioactive 
      forms. Immunohistochemical analysis of the microRNA processing machinery in IPF 
      lung specimens revealed decreased Dicer1 expression in the procollagen-rich 
      myofibroblastic core of fibroblastic foci compared with the focus perimeter and 
      adjacent alveolar walls. Mechanistically, IPF-ECM increased association of the 
      Dicer1 transcript with RNA binding protein AUF1 (AU-binding factor 1), and Dicer1 
      knockdown conferred primary human lung fibroblasts with cell-autonomous 
      fibrogenicity in zebrafish and mouse lung xenograft models. CONCLUSIONS: Our data 
      identify suppression of fibroblast Dicer1 expression in the myofibroblast-rich 
      IPF fibroblastic focus core as a central step in the mechanism by which the ECM 
      sustains fibrosis progression in IPF.

AB  - The contribution of the immune system to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) 
      remains poorly understood. While most sources agree that IPF does not result from 
      a primary immunopathogenic mechanism, evidence gleaned from animal modeling and 
      human studies suggests that innate and adaptive immune processes can orchestrate 
      existing fibrotic responses. This review will synthesize the available data 
      regarding the complex role of professional immune cells in IPF. The role of 
      innate immune populations such as monocytes, macrophages, myeloid suppressor 
      cells, and innate lymphoid cells will be discussed, as will the activation of 
      these cells via pathogen-associated molecular patterns derived from invading or 
      commensural microbes, and danger-associated molecular patterns derived from 
      injured cells and tissues. The contribution of adaptive immune responses driven 
      by T-helper cells and B cells will be reviewed as well. Each form of immune 
      activation will be discussed in the context of its relationship to environmental 
      and genetic factors, disease outcomes, and potential therapies. We conclude with 
      discussion of unanswered questions and opportunities for future study in this 
      area.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic fibrotic disease of the lung 
      that is marked by progressive decline in pulmonary function and ultimately 
      respiratory failure. Genetic and environmental risk factors have been identified 
      that indicate injury to, and dysfunction of the lung epithelium is central to 
      initiating the pathogenic process. Following injury to the lung epithelium, 
      growth factors, matrikines and extracellular matrix driven signaling together 
      activate a variety of repair pathways that lead to inflammatory cell recruitment, 
      fibroblast proliferation and expansion of the extracellular matrix, culminating 
      in tissue fibrosis. This tissue fibrosis then leads to changes in the biochemical 
      and biomechanical properties of the extracellular matrix, which potentiate 
      profibrotic mechanisms through a "feed-forward cycle." This review provides an 
      overview of the interactions of the pathogenic mechanisms of IPF with a focus on 
      epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk and the extracellular matrix as a therapeutic 
      target for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

TI  - Targeting of TAM Receptors Ameliorates Fibrotic Mechanisms in Idiopathic 
      Pulmonary Fibrosis.

AB  - RATIONALE: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by aberrant lung 
      remodeling, which progressively abolishes lung function in an RTK (receptor 
      tyrosine kinase)-dependent manner. Gas6 (growth arrest-specific 6) ligand, Tyro3 
      (TYRO3 protein tyrosine kinase 3), and Axl (anexelekto) RTK expression and 
      activity are increased in IPF. OBJECTIVES: To determine if targeting these RTK 
      pathways would inhibit fibroblast activation and the development of pulmonary 
      fibrosis. METHODS: Quantitative genomic, proteomic, and functional analyses were 
      used to determine Gas6/TAM (Tyro3, Axl, and Mertk [MER proto-oncogene, tyrosine 
      kinase]) RTK expression and activation in tissues and fibroblasts from normal and 
      IPF lungs. The profibrotic impact of these RTK pathways were also examined in 
      bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and in SCID/Bg mice that developed pulmonary 
      fibrosis after the intravenous administration of primary IPF fibroblasts. 
      MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Gas6, Axl, and Tyro3 were increased in both 
      rapidly and slowly progressive IPF compared with normal lung samples and 
      fibroblasts. Targeting these pathways with either specific antibodies directed at 
      Gas6 or Axl, or with small-molecule TAM inhibitors indicated that the small 
      molecule-mediated targeting approach was more efficacious in both in vitro and in 
      vivo studies. Specifically, the TAM receptor inhibitor R428 (also known as 
      BGB324) significantly inhibited the synthetic, migratory, and proliferative 
      properties of IPF fibroblasts compared with the other Gas6/TAM receptor targeting 
      agents. Finally, loss of Gas6 expression decreased lung fibrotic responses to 
      bleomycin and treatment with R428 inhibited pulmonary fibrosis in humanized 
      SCID/Bg mice. CONCLUSIONS: Gas6/TAM receptor activity contributes to the 
      activation of pulmonary fibroblasts in IPF, suggesting that targeting this RTK 
      pathway might be an effective antifibrotic strategy in this disease.

TI  - The Role of ADAR1 and ADAR2 in the Regulation of miRNA-21 in Idiopathic Pulmonary 
      Fibrosis.
PG  - 393-400
LID - 10.1007/s00408-018-0115-9 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: microRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding 1RNAs that 
      post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. Recent evidence shows that 
      adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADAR) can edit miRNAs. miRNAs are involved 
      in the development of different diseases, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
      (IPF). In IPF, about 40% of the miRNAs are differentially expressed with respect 
      to controls. Among these miRNAs, miRNA-21 has been found over-expressed in IPF 
      and its targets are anti-fibrosing molecules such as PELI1 and SPRY2. The 
      objective of this study is to determine the role of ADAR1 and 2 on the expression 
      of miRNA-21 in human lung fibroblasts trough quantification of gene expression, 
      protein levels, and overexpression of ADAR1 and 2. METHODS: Six control and six 
      fibrotic primary fibroblast cell cultures were used for RNA extraction, ADAR1, 
      ADAR2, PELI1, SPRY2, miRNA-21, and pri-miRNA-21 expression was measured. 
      Subsequently, two fibrotic fibroblast cultures were used for overexpression of 
      ADAR1 and ADAR2, and they were stimulated with TGFbeta1. Real-time PCR and Western 
      blot were performed. RESULTS: ADAR1 is significantly downregulated in IPF 
      fibroblasts; the overexpression of ADAR1 and ADAR2 reestablishes the expression 
      levels of miRNA-21, PELI1, and SPRY2 in fibroblasts of patients with IPF. 
      CONCLUSION: These changes in the processing of miRNAs have great value in 
      pathology diagnosis, including lung diseases, and play an important role in the 
      understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in the development of different 
      pathologies, as well as representing new therapeutic targets.

TI  - FOXF1 Inhibits Pulmonary Fibrosis by Preventing CDH2-CDH11 Cadherin Switch in 
      Myofibroblasts.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by aberrant accumulation of 
      collagen-secreting myofibroblasts. Development of effective therapies is limited 
      due to incomplete understanding of molecular mechanisms regulating myofibroblast 
      expansion. FOXF1 transcription factor is expressed in resident lung fibroblasts, 
      but its role in lung fibrosis remains unknown due to the lack of genetic mouse 
      models. Through comprehensive analysis of human IPF genomics data, lung biopsies, 
      and transgenic mice with fibroblast-specific inactivation of FOXF1, we show that 
      FOXF1 inhibits pulmonary fibrosis. FOXF1 deletion increases myofibroblast 
      invasion and collagen secretion and promotes a switch from N-cadherin (CDH2) to 
      Cadherin-11 (CDH11), which is a critical step in the acquisition of the 
      pro-fibrotic phenotype. FOXF1 directly binds to Cdh2 and Cdh11 promoters and 
      differentially regulates transcription of these genes. Re-expression of CDH2 or 
      inhibition of CDH11 in FOXF1-deficient cells reduces myofibroblast invasion 
      in vitro. FOXF1 inhibits pulmonary fibrosis by regulating a switch from CDH2 to 
      CDH11 in lung myofibroblasts.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive, fibrotic 
      parenchymal lung disease of unknown etiology and lacks an effective intervention. 
      Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in organ fibrosis and various pulmonary 
      diseases, but the role of lncRNAs in lung fibrosis is not fully understood. In 
      the present study, we identified that lncRNA NONMMUT021928, designated as 
      pulmonary fibrosis-associated lncRNA (PFAL), was up-regulated in the lungs of 
      mice with experimental lung fibrosis, and in TGF-beta1-induced fibrotic lung 
      fibroblasts. Further study showed that overexpression of PFAL promoted cell 
      proliferation, migration, and fibroblast-myofibroblast transition. Overexpression 
      further resulted in extracellular matrix deposition and fibrogenesis in lung 
      fibroblasts through regulation of microRNA-18a (miR-18a). Importantly, knockdown 
      of PFAL alleviated lung fibrosis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, our 
      study showed that PFAL promoted lung-fibroblast activation and fibrogenesis by 
      acting as a competing endogenous RNA for miR-18a: forced expression of PFAL 
      inhibited the expression and activity of miR-18a, whereas silencing of PFAL had 
      the opposite effect. Furthermore, we found that miR-18a was decreased during lung 
      fibrosis in vitro and in vivo, as well as in patients with IPF. Moreover, 
      knockdown of miR-18a led to fibrogenesis in lung fibroblasts, whereas enhanced 
      expression of miR-18a attenuated TGF-beta1-induced lung fibrosis by directly 
      targeting the regulation of connecting tissue growth factor. Taken together, 
      these results revealed the effect and mechanism of lncRNA PFAL in pulmonary 
      fibrosis and suggested that PFAL depletion may provide a novel strategy for the 
      treatment of lung fibrosis.-Li, X., Yu, T., Shan, H., Jiang, H., Sun, J., Zhao,

AB  - Many studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in the 
      development of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The purpose of this review is 
      to systematically summarize the recent advance of miRNAs in the pathology of IPF, 
      highlighting the new research progress and their pathophysiological implication. 
      Recent studies have shown that miRNAs differentially expressed in blood and lung 
      tissue from IPF patients are closely related to the occurrence of IPF disease, 
      which may be IPF diagnostic markers and prognostic indicators. Furthermore, 
      studies have shown that miRNAs are involved in the pathological mechanisms of 
      IPF, including the lung epithelial repair, epithelial-mesenchymal transition 
      (EMT), fibroblast activation, myofibroblast differentiation, macrophage 
      polarization, alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) senescence and collagen production. 
      In this review, the regulation mechanisms of miRNAs in IPF pathology, such as the 
      long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in miRNA expression, the cross-talk among miRNAs, 
      and the mutual effect of miRNA and DNA methylation, are also systematically 
      reviewed. According to the recent studies of miRNAs in the pathology of IPF, 
      miRNAs play important roles in the pathogenesis of IPF, and miRNAs involved in 
      IPF pathology are helpful to elucidate the pathogenesis of IPF and the treatment 
      of this disease.

AB  - Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a pivotal role in idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). In bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis mice, we 
      observed that inhibition of mTOR (mammalia target of rapamycin) attenuated IPF. 
      Rapamycin suppressed the down-regulation of E-cadherin and up-regulation of 
      fibronectin in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis mice. In addition, dual 
      immunofluorescence staining for E-cadherin and fibronectin demonstrated that 
      rapamycin pretreatment decreased the proportions of AECs undergoing EMT in 
      bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, indicating that mTOR inhibition suppressed 
      EMT in vivo. In the setting of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1-induced EMT in 
      AECs, we found that mTOR inhibitor attenuated TGF-beta1-induced EMT in AECs. This 
      EMT was characterized by morphology and cell skeleton changes and the expression 
      of EMT phenotype markers. Finally, mTOR blockade decreased S6k and TGF-beta1-induced 
      Smad2/3 phosphorylation. Bleomycin induced pulmonary fibrosis and EMT in mice, 
      while mTOR repression inhibited bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and 
      attenuated EMT in vivo. Hence, our study provided evidence of a novel mechanism 
      by which mTOR inhibitor ameliorates pulmonary fibrosis. Suppression of mTOR and 
      EMT may be a target for treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.

TI  - Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase-N13 Promotes Myofibroblast Resistance to Apoptosis 
      in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.
PG  - 914-927
LID - 10.1164/rccm.201707-1497OC [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, fibrotic 
      interstitial lung disease characterized by (myo)fibroblast accumulation and 
      collagen deposition. Resistance to Fas-induced apoptosis is thought to facilitate 
      (myo)fibroblast persistence in fibrotic lung tissues by poorly understood 
      mechanisms. OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that PTPN13 (protein tyrosine 
      phosphatase-N13) is expressed by IPF lung (myo)fibroblasts, promotes their 
      resistance to Fas-induced apoptosis, and contributes to the development of 
      pulmonary fibrosis. METHODS: PTPN13 was localized in lung tissues from patients 
      with IPF and control subjects by immunohistochemical staining. Inhibition of 
      PTPN13 function in primary IPF and normal lung (myo)fibroblasts was accomplished 
      by: 1) downregulation with TNF-alpha (tumor necrosis factor-alpha)/IFN-gamma, 2) siRNA 
      knockdown, or 3) a cell-permeable Fas/PTPN13 interaction inhibitory peptide. The 
      role of PTPN13 in the development of pulmonary fibrosis was assessed in mice with 
      genetic deficiency of PTP-BL, the murine ortholog of PTPN13. MEASUREMENTS AND 
      MAIN RESULTS: PTPN13 was constitutively expressed by (myo)fibroblasts in the 
      fibroblastic foci of patients with IPF. Human lung (myo)fibroblasts, which are 
      resistant to Fas-induced apoptosis, basally expressed PTPN13 in vitro. 
      TNF-alpha/IFN-gamma or siRNA-mediated PTPN13 downregulation and peptide-mediated 
      inhibition of the Fas/PTPN13 interaction in human lung (myo)fibroblasts promoted 
      Fas-induced apoptosis. Bleomycin-challenged PTP-BL(-/-) mice, while developing 
      inflammatory lung injury, exhibited reduced pulmonary fibrosis compared with 
      wild-type mice. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that PTPN13 mediates the 
      resistance of human lung (myo)fibroblasts to Fas-induced apoptosis and promotes 
      pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Our results suggest that strategies aimed at 
      interfering with PTPN13 expression or function may represent a novel strategy to 
      reduce fibrosis in IPF.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remains a truly idiopathic fibrotic disease, 
      with a modest genetic predilection and candidate triggers but no overall 
      explanation for the development of disease in non-familial cases. Agreement on 
      terminology has contributed to major clinical and translational advances since 
      the millennium. It is likely that the entity currently captured by the term "IPF" 
      will be radically reclassified over the next decade, either through "splitting" 
      (into IPF subgroups responding selectively to individual disease-modifying 
      agents) or through "lumping" of IPF with other forms of progressive fibrotic lung 
      disease (with shared pathogenetic mechanisms and IPF-like disease behaviour). In 
      this perspective, we summarise the clinical and pathogenetic justification for a 
      focus on "the progressive fibrotic phenotype" in future clinical and 
      translational research. By this means, we can hope to address the needs of 
      non-IPF patients with inexorably progressive fibrotic disease, currently 
      disenfranchised by lack of access to agents that are efficacious in IPF. In this 
      regard, ongoing trials of anti-fibrotic therapies in non-IPF patients with 
      progressive fibrosis may be highly influential. Future revision of IPF 
      nomenclature may be warranted if there are major conceptual changes but without 
      compelling justification, the benefits of renaming IPF are likely to be 
      outweighed by the resulting confusion.

TI  - MicroRNA-708-3p as a potential therapeutic target via the ADAM17-GATA/STAT3 axis 
      in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - e465
LID - 10.1038/emm.2017.311 [doi]
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for 
      many diseases. However, the miRNAs that control the pathogenesis of idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and act as potential therapeutic targets for the disease 
      are rarely studied. In the present study, we analyzed the function and regulatory 
      mechanism of microRNA-708-3p (miR-708-3p) and evaluated this marker's potential 
      as a therapeutic target in IPF. The clinical and biological relevance of 
      fibrogenesis for miR-708-3p was assessed in vivo and in vitro, specifically in 
      matching plasma and tissue samples from 78 patients with IPF. The data showed 
      that the miR-708-3p levels decreased during fibrosis and inversely correlated 
      with IPF. The experiments showed that the decreased miR-708 promoter activity and 
      primer-miR-708(pri-miR-708) expression were the potential causes. By 
      computational analysis, a dual luciferase reporter system, rescue experiments and 
      a Cignal Finder 45-Pathway system with siADAM17 and a miR-708-3p mimic, we 
      identified that miR-708-3p directly regulates its target gene, a disintegrin and 
      metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17), through a binding site in the 3' untranslated 
      region, which depends on the GATA/STAT3 signaling pathway. Finally, an miR-708-3p 
      agomir was designed and used to test the therapeutic effects of the miR-708-3p in 
      an animal model. Small-animal imaging technology and other experiments showed 
      that the dynamic image distribution of the miR-708-3p agomir was mainly 
      concentrated in the lungs and could block fibrogenesis. In conclusion, the 
      miR-708-3p-ADAM17 axis aggravates IPF, and miR-708-3p can serve as a potential 
      therapeutic target for IPF.

      a candidate gene sequencing study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) risk has a strong genetic 
      component. Studies have implicated variations at several loci, including TERT, 
      surfactant genes, and a single nucleotide polymorphism at chr11p15 (rs35705950) 
      in the intergenic region between TOLLIP and MUC5B. Patients with IPF who have 
      risk alleles at rs35705950 have longer survival from the time of IPF diagnosis 
      than do patients homozygous for the non-risk allele, whereas patients with 
      shorter telomeres have shorter survival times. We aimed to assess whether rare 
      protein-altering variants in genes regulating telomere length are enriched in 
      patients with IPF homozygous for the non-risk alleles at rs35705950. METHODS: 
      Between Nov 1, 2014, and Nov 1, 2016, we assessed blood samples from patients 
      aged 40 years or older and of European ancestry with sporadic IPF from three 
      international phase 3 clinical trials (INSPIRE, CAPACITY, ASCEND), one phase 2 
      study (RIFF), and US-based observational studies (Vanderbilt Clinical 
      Interstitial Lung Disease Registry and the UCSF Interstitial Lung Disease Clinic 
      registry cohorts) at the Broad Institute (Cambridge, MA, USA) and Human Longevity 
      (San Diego, CA, USA). We also assessed blood samples from non-IPF controls in 
      several clinical trials. We did whole-genome sequencing to assess telomere length 
      and identify rare protein-altering variants, stratified by rs35705950 genotype. 
      We also assessed rare functional variation in TERT exons and compared telomere 
      length and disease progression across genotypes. FINDINGS: We assessed samples 
      from 1510 patients with IPF and 1874 non-IPF controls. 30 (3%) of 1046 patients 
      with an rs35705950 risk allele had a rare protein-altering variant in TERT 
      compared with 34 (7%) of 464 non-risk allele carriers (odds ratio 0.40 [95% CI 
      0.24-0.66], p=0.00039). Subsequent analyses identified enrichment of rare 
      protein-altering variants in PARN and RTEL1, and rare variation in TERC in 
      patients with IPF compared with controls. We expanded our study population to 
      provide a more accurate estimation of rare variant frequency in these four loci, 
      and to calculate telomere length. The proportion of patients with at least one 
      rare variant in TERT, PARN, TERC, or RTEL1 was higher in patients with IPF than 
      in controls (149 [9%] of 1739 patients vs 205 [2%] of 8645 controls, 
      p=2.44 x 10(-8)). Patients with IPF who had a variant in any of the four 
      identified telomerase component genes had telomeres that were 3.69-16.10% shorter 
      than patients without a variant in any of the four genes and had an earlier mean 
      age of disease onset than patients without one or more variants (65.1 years [SD 
      7.8] vs 67.1 years [7.9], p=0.004). In the placebo arms of clinical trials, 
      shorter telomeres were significantly associated with faster disease progression 
      (1.7% predicted forced vital capacity per kb per year, p=0.002). Pirfenidone had 
      treatment benefit regardless of telomere length (p=4.24 x 10(-8) for telomere 
      length lower than the median, p=0.0044 for telomere length greater than the 
      median). INTERPRETATION: Rare protein-altering variants in TERT, PARN, TERC, and 
      RTEL1 are enriched in patients with IPF compared with controls, and, in the case 
      of TERT, particularly in individuals without a risk allele at the rs35705950 
      locus. This suggests that multiple genetic factors contribute to sporadic IPF, 
      which might implicate distinct mechanisms of pathogenesis and disease 
      progression. FUNDING: Genentech, National Institutes of Health, Francis Family

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating interstitial lung disease, 
      characterized by damage of lung epithelial cells, excessive deposition of 
      extracellular matrix in the lung interstitium, and enhanced activation and 
      proliferation of fibroblasts. S100a4, also termed FSP-1 (fibroblast-specific 
      protein-1), was previously considered as a marker of fibroblasts but recent 
      findings in renal and liver fibrosis indicated that M2 macrophages are an 
      important cellular source of S100a4. Thus, we hypothesized that also in pulmonary 
      fibrosis, M2 macrophages produce and secrete S100a4, and that secreted S100a4 
      induces the proliferation and activation of fibroblasts. To prove this 
      hypothesis, we comprehensively characterized two established mouse models of lung 
      fibrosis: infection of IFN-gammaR(-/-) mice with MHV-68 and intratracheal application 
      of bleomycin to C57BL/6 mice. We further provide in vitro data using primary 
      macrophages and fibroblasts to investigate the mechanism by which S100A4 exerts 
      its effects. Finally, we inhibit S100a4 in vivo in the bleomycin-induced lung 
      fibrosis model by treatment with niclosamide. Our data suggest that S100a4 is 
      produced and secreted by M2 polarized alveolar macrophages and enhances the 
      proliferation and activation of lung fibroblasts. Inhibition of S100a4 might 
      represent a potential therapeutic strategy for pulmonary fibrosis.

TI  - Targeted resequencing reveals genetic risks in patients with sporadic idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 1238-1245
LID - 10.1002/humu.23566 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a genetic heterogeneous disease with high 
      mortality and poor prognosis. However, a large fraction of genetic cause remains 
      unexplained, especially in sporadic IPF ( approximately 80% IPF). By systemically reviewing 
      related literature and potential pathogenic pathways, 92 potentially IPF-related 
      genes were selected and sequenced in genomic DNAs from 253 sporadic IPF patients 
      and 125 matched health controls using targeted massively parallel next-generation 
      sequencing. The identified risk variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. We 
      identified two pathogenic and 10 loss-of-function (LOF) candidate variants, 
      accounting for 4.74% (12 out of 253) of all the IPF cases. In burden tests, rare 
      missense variants in three genes (CSF3R, DSP, and LAMA3) were identified that 
      have a statistically significant relationship with IPF. Four common SNPs 
      (rs3737002, rs2296160, rs1800470, and rs35705950) were observed to be 
      statistically associated with increased risk of IPF. In the cumulative risk 
      model, high risk subjects had 3.47-fold (95%CI: 2.07-5.81, P = 2.34 x 10(-6) ) 
      risk of developing IPF compared with low risk subjects. We drafted a 
      comprehensive map of genetic risks (including both rare and common candidate 
      variants) in patients with IPF, which could provide insights to help in 
      understanding mechanisms, providing genetic diagnosis, and predicting risk for 
      IPF.

      Editing.
PG  - 599-609

AB  - RATIONALE: DSP (desmoplakin), the most abundant component of desmosomes, which 
      maintain the mechanical integrity of epithelium, is a genome-wide association 
      study-identified genetic risk locus in human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). 
      Subjects with IPF express a significantly higher level of DSP than control 
      subjects. OBJECTIVES: Determine potential mechanisms by which DSP is regulated in 
      lung fibrosis. METHODS: Matrigel-coated soft and stiff polyacrylamide gels were 
      made to simulate the stiffness of normal and fibrotic lungs. Quantitative 
      chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assay were used 
      to evaluate transcription factor binding to the DSP promoter. Targeted DNA 
      methylation was achieved by CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short 
      palindromic repeats)/dCas9 (deactivated CRISPR-associated protein-9 
      nuclease)-mediated Dnmt3A (DNA methyltransferase 3A) expression under the 
      guidance of sequence-specific single guide RNAs. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: 
      Stiff matrix promotes DSP gene expression in both human and rodent lung 
      epithelial cells as compared with soft matrix. A conserved region in the proximal 
      DSP promoter is hypermethylated under soft matrix conditions and becomes 
      hypomethylated/demethylated under stiff matrix conditions. Demethylation of this 
      conserved DSP promoter region is associated with transactivation of transcription 
      factor EGR1 (early growth response protein 1), resulting in EGR1-dependent DSP 
      overexpression. Targeted DNA methylation by CRISPR/dCas9/Dnmt3A-mediated 
      epigenome editing blocks EGR1 binding to the DSP promoter and inhibits stiff 
      matrix-induced DSP overexpression. CONCLUSIONS: DSP is a matrix 
      stiffness-regulated mechanosensitive gene. CRISPR/dCas9-Dnmt3A-mediated epigenome 
      editing reverses DSP overexpression by reestablishment of the epigenetic control 
      of DSP under the mechanically homeostatic environment. It provides a useful tool 
      for investigations of the functional role of DSP in the pathogenesis of lung 
      fibrosis.

TI  - Telomere shortening activates TGF-beta/Smads signaling in lungs and enhances both 
      lipopolysaccharide and bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - Telomere shortening is associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a 
      high-morbidity and high-mortality lung disease of unknown etiology. However, the 
      underlying mechanisms remain largely unclear. In this study, wild-type (WT) mice 
      with normal telomeres and generation 3 (G3) or G2 telomerase RNA component (TERC) 
      knockout Terc(-)(/-) mice with short telomeres were treated with and without 
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or bleomycin by intratracheal injection. We show that 
      under LPS induction, G3 Terc(-)(/-) mice develop aggravated pulmonary fibrosis as 
      indicated by significantly increased alpha-SMA, collagen I and hydroxyproline 
      content. Interestingly, TGF-beta/Smads signaling is markedly activated in the lungs 
      of G3 Terc(-)(/-) mice, as indicated by markedly elevated levels of 
      phosphorylated Smad3 and TGF-beta1, compared with those of WT mice. This TGF-beta/Smads 
      signaling activation is significantly increased in the lungs of LPS-treated G3 
      Terc(-)(/-) mice compared with those of LPS-treated WT or untreated G3 
      Terc(-)(/-) mice. A similar pattern of TGF-beta/Smads signaling activation and the 
      enhancing role of telomere shortening in pulmonary fibrosis are also confirmed in 
      bleomycin-induced model. Moreover, LPS challenge produced more present cellular 
      senescence, apoptosis and infiltration of innate immune cells, including 
      macrophages and neutrophils in the lungs of G3 Terc(-)(/-) mice, compared with WT 
      mice. To our knowledge, this is the first time to report telomere shortening 
      activated TGF-beta/Smads signaling in lungs. Our data suggest that telomere 
      shortening cooperated with environment-induced lung injury accelerates the 
      development of pulmonary fibrosis, and telomere shortening confers an inherent 
      enhancing factor to the genesis of IPF through activation of TGF-beta/Smads 
      signaling.

TI  - Astragaloside IV modulates TGF-beta1-dependent epithelial-mesenchymal transition in 
      bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 4354-4365
LID - 10.1111/jcmm.13725 [doi]
AB  - Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Astragaloside IV (ASV), a natural saponin from 
      astragalus membranaceus, has shown anti-fibrotic property in bleomycin 
      (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis. The current study was undertaken to determine 
      whether EMT was involved in the beneficial of ASV against BLM-induced pulmonary 
      fibrosis and to elucidate its potential mechanism. As expected, in BLM-induced 
      IPF, ASV exerted protective effects on pulmonary fibrosis and ASV significantly 
      reversed BLM-induced EMT. Intriguing, transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) was 
      found to be up-regulated, whereas Forkhead box O3a (FOXO3a) was 
      hyperphosphorylated and less expressed. However, ASV treatment inhibited 
      increased TGF-beta1 and activated FOXO3a in lung tissues. TGF-beta1 was administered to 
      alveolar epithelial cells A549 to induce EMT in vitro. Meanwhile, stimulation 
      with TGF-beta1-activated phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) 
      pathway and induced FOXO3a hyperphosphorylated and down-regulated. It was found 
      that overexpression of FOXO3a leading to the suppression of TGF-beta1-induced EMT. 
      Moreover, ASV treatment, similar with the TGF-beta1 or PI3K/Akt inhibitor, reverted 
      these cellular changes and inhibited EMT in A549 cells. Collectively, the results 
      suggested that ASV significantly inhibited TGF-beta1/PI3K/Akt-induced FOXO3a 
      hyperphosphorylation and down-regulation to reverse EMT during the progression of 
      fibrosis.

TI  - lncRNA PFAR Promotes Lung Fibroblast Activation and Fibrosis by Targeting miR-138 
      to Regulate the YAP1-Twist Axis.

AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to be involved in various 
      pathophysiological processes in many diseases. However, the role and mechanism of 
      lncRNAs in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) have not been explicitly 
      delineated. In the present study, we reported that lncRNA NONMMUT065582, 
      designated pulmonary fibrosis-associated RNA (PFAR), is upregulated in the lungs 
      of mice with lung fibrosis as well as in fibrotic lung fibroblasts. 
      Overexpression of PFAR promoted fibrogenesis through modulation of miR-138, 
      whereas knockdown of PFAR attenuated TGF-beta1-induced fibrogenesis in lung 
      fibroblasts. In addition, knockdown of miR-138 promoted fibrogenesis by targeting 
      regulation of yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), whereas enhanced expression of 
      miR-138 attenuated fibrogenesis in lung fibroblasts. Mechanistically, PFAR acted 
      as competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) of miR-138: forced expression of PFAR reduced 
      the expression and activity of miR-138 to activate YAP1 and promote fibrogenesis 
      in lung fibroblasts, whereas loss of YAP1 abrogated the pro-fibrotic effect of 
      PFAR. More importantly, PFAR silencing alleviated BLM-induced lung fibrosis in 
      mice. Taken together, the results of our study identified lncRNA PFAR as a new 
      pro-fibrotic molecule that acts as a ceRNA of miR-138 during lung fibrosis and 
      demonstrated PFAR as a novel therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment 
      of lung fibrosis.

AB  - Polysaccharides from Dendrobium officinale (PDO) have been found to elicit 
      significant benefits for patients with fibrotic diseases. However, there are no 
      reports on treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) using PDO. The aim of 
      this paper was to investigate the therapeutic effects of PDO on IPF and its 
      underlying mechanisms. Our data showed that PDO significantly ameliorated indices 
      for both pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in a bleomycin (BLM)-induced 
      pulmonary fibrosis model in rats, which was associated with inactivation of 
      transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1)-Smad2/3 signaling pathway. Moreover, PDO 
      effectively blocked TGFbeta1-induced transformation of rat alveolar epithelial type 
      II cells into myofibroblasts, with the inhibition of total Smad2/3, pSmad2/3, 
      collagen I and fibronectin protein expression in a dose-dependent manner in 
      vitro. Therefore, PDO may represent as a promising candidate biomacromolecule 
      drug for the safe and effective therapy of IPF.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an important public health problem, and it 
      has few treatment options given its poorly understood etiology; however, 
      epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of pneumocytes has been implicated as 
      a factor. Herein, we aimed to explore the underlying mechanisms of lung fibrosis 
      mediated by EMT, with a focus on the alternative splicing of fibroblast growth 
      factor receptor 2 (FGFR2), using bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung fibrotic and 
      transgenic mouse models. We employed BLM-induced and surfactant protein C 
      (SPC)-Cre and LacZ double transgenic mouse models. The results showed that EMT 
      occurred during lung fibrosis. BLM inhibited the expression of epithelial 
      splicing regulatory protein 1 (ESRP1), resulting in enhanced alternative splicing 
      of FGFR2 to the mesenchymal isoform IIIc. BLM-induced lung fibrosis was also 
      associated with the activation of TGF-beta/Smad signaling. These findings have 
      implications for rationally targetted strategies to therapeutically address IPF.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and irreversible interstitial 
      lung disease with a poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options. Over the past 
      decade, research efforts have focused on the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in 
      this enigmatic lung disease. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory 
      autoimmune disease often complicated by the development of interstitial lung 
      disease (ILD), leading to high mortality and morbidity. Autophagy is a process 
      regulating the turnover of subcellular components and organelles, and represents 
      a major cellular homeostatic mechanism. Recent evidence suggests a role of 
      autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction in the development of IPF, focusing on 
      lung fibroblasts and epithelial cells. The aim of this study was to examine the 
      mRNA levels of molecules involved inthe autophagy pathway in bronchoalveolar 
      lavage fluid (BALF)‑derived cellsfrom patients with IPF in comparison topatients 
      with RA demonstrating lung involvement (ILD) by RT-qPCR. The significant 
      upregulation of BECLIN1 was observed in patients with RA-ILD compared with those 
      with IPF. Other genes involved in the autophagy pathway were also examined, such 
      as Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1), BCL2 interacting 
      protein 3 (BNIP3) and p62. No differences in the mRNA expression levels of these 
      genes were observed. As regards the selective degradation of mitochondria and 
      mitophagy, similar PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) and PARKIN; E3 
      ubiquitin ligase (PRKN) expression, as well as PINK1 protein levels, were 
      observed. On the whole, the findings of this study demonstrate an increased 
      expression of BECLIN1 in BALF cells from patients with RA-ILD compared with those 
      from patients with IPF, while similar levels in other key molecules implicating 
      in the autophagy pathway were observed in patients with IPF and RA-ILD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical-radiographic distinction between idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF) and non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) is challenging. We 
      sought to investigate the gene expression profiles of IPF and NSIP vs. normal 
      controls. METHODS: Gene expression from explanted lungs of patients with IPF 
      (n = 22), NSIP (n = 10) and from normal controls (n = 11) was assessed. 
      Microarray analysis included Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM), Ingenuity 
      Pathway, Gene-Set Enrichment and unsupervised hierarchical clustering analyses. 
      Immunohistochemistry and serology of proteins of interest were conducted. 
      RESULTS: NSIP cases were significantly enriched for genes related to mechanisms 
      of immune reaction, such as T-cell response and recruitment of leukocytes into 
      the lung compartment. In IPF, in contrast, these involved senescence, 
      epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, myofibroblast differentiation and collagen 
      deposition. Unlike the IPF group, NSIP cases exhibited a strikingly homogenous 
      gene signature. Clustering analysis identified a subgroup of IPF patients with 
      intermediate and ambiguous expression of SAM-selected genes, with the interesting 
      upregulation of both NSIP-specific and senescence-related genes. 
      Immunohistochemistry for p16, a senescence marker, on fibroblasts differentiated 
      most IPF cases from NSIP. Serial serum levels of periostin, a senescence 
      effector, predicted clinical progression in a cohort of patients with IPF. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive gene expression profiling in explanted lungs 
      identifies distinct transcriptional profiles and differentially expressed genes 
      in IPF and NSIP, supporting the notion of NSIP as a standalone condition. 
      Potential gene and protein markers to discriminate IPF from NSIP were identified, 
      with a prominent role of senescence in IPF. The finding of a subgroup of IPF 
      patients with transcriptional features of both NSIP and senescence raises the 
      hypothesis that "senescent" NSIP may represent a risk factor to develop 
      superimposed IPF.

TI  - Glutaminolysis Epigenetically Regulates Antiapoptotic Gene Expression in 
      Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Fibroblasts.
PG  - 49-57
LID - 10.1165/rcmb.2018-0180OC [doi]
AB  - Fibrotic responses involve multiple cellular processes, including epigenetic 
      changes. Epigenetic changes are sensitive to alterations in the tissue 
      microenvironment such as the flux of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites. 
      TCA metabolites directly regulate epigenetic states, in part by regulating 
      histone modification-related enzymes. Glutaminolysis is a critical metabolic 
      process by which glutamine is converted to glutamate by glutaminase and then to 
      alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG), a TCA cycle metabolite. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
      (IPF) is a disease characterized by aberrant metabolism, including enhanced 
      glutaminolysis. IPF fibroblasts are apoptosis resistant. In this study, we 
      explored the relationship between glutaminolysis and the resistance to apoptosis 
      of IPF fibroblasts. Inhibition of glutaminolysis decreased expression of XIAP and 
      survivin, members of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family. alpha-KG is a 
      cofactor for JMJD3 histone demethylase, which targets H3K27me3. In the absence of 
      glutamine, JMJD3 activity in fibroblasts is significantly decreased, whereas 
      H3K27me3 levels are increased. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed 
      that JMJD3 directly interacts with XIAP and survivin promoter regions in a 
      glutamine-dependent manner. Exogenous alpha-KG partially restores JMJD3 function and 
      its interaction with the XIAP and survivin promoter regions under 
      glutamine-deficient conditions. Interestingly, alpha-KG upregulates XIAP, but not 
      survivin, suggesting differential alpha-KG-dependent and -independent mechanisms by 
      which glutamine regulates these IAPs. Our data demonstrate a novel mechanism of 
      metabolic regulation in which glutaminolysis promotes apoptosis resistance of IPF 
      fibroblasts through epigenetic regulation of XIAP and survivin.

TI  - Localized hypoxia links ER stress to lung fibrosis through induction of C/EBP 
      homologous protein.

AB  - ER stress in type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) is common in idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), but the contribution of ER stress to lung fibrosis is 
      poorly understood. We found that mice deficient in C/EBP homologous protein 
      (CHOP), an ER stress-regulated transcription factor, were protected from lung 
      fibrosis and AEC apoptosis in 3 separate models where substantial ER stress was 
      identified. In mice treated with repetitive intratracheal bleomycin, we 
      identified localized hypoxia in type II AECs as a potential mechanism explaining 
      ER stress. To test the role of hypoxia in lung fibrosis, we treated mice with 
      bleomycin, followed by exposure to 14% O2, which exacerbated ER stress and lung 
      fibrosis. Under these experimental conditions, CHOP-/- mice, but not mice with 
      epithelial HIF (HIF1/HIF2) deletion, were protected from AEC apoptosis and 
      fibrosis. In vitro studies revealed that CHOP regulates hypoxia-induced apoptosis 
      in AECs via the inositol-requiring enzyme 1alpha (IRE1alpha) and the PKR-like ER kinase 
      (PERK) pathways. In human IPF lungs, CHOP and hypoxia markers were both 
      upregulated in type II AECs, supporting a conclusion that localized hypoxia 
      results in ER stress-induced CHOP expression, thereby augmenting type II AEC 
      apoptosis and potentiating lung fibrosis.

TI  - Downregulation of microRNA-9 reduces inflammatory response and fibroblast 
      proliferation in mice with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis through the 
      ANO1-mediated TGF-beta-Smad3 pathway.
PG  - 2552-2565
LID - 10.1002/jcp.26961 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive interstitial lung disease 
      with increasing occurrence, high death rates and unfavorable treatment regimens. 
      In the current study, we identified the expression of microRNA-9 (miR-9) and 
      anoctamin-1 (ANO1) in IPF mouse models induced by bleomycin, and their effects on 
      inflammation and fibroblast proliferation through the transforming growth 
      factor-beta (TGF-beta)-Smad3 pathway. To verify the targeting relationship between 
      miR-9 and ANO1, we used bioinformatics prediction and conducted a dual-luciferase 
      reporter gene assay. The underlying regulatory mechanisms of miR-9 and the target 
      gene ANO1 were investigated mainly with the treatment of miR-9 mimic, miR-9 
      inhibitor, or siRNA against ANO1 in fibroblasts isolated from IPF mice. 
      Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to investigate the effect of 
      miR-9 or ANO1 on inflammatory factors. 
      3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and flow 
      cytometry were used to detect fibroblast proliferation and apoptosis. Reverse 
      transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis 
      were applied to measure the expression of the TGF-beta-Smad3 pathway-related genes. 
      The determination of luciferase activity suggested that miR-9 targets ANO1. 
      Upregulation of miR-9 or silencing of ANO1 intensified inflammation in IPF, 
      promoted proliferation and inhibited apoptotic ability of lung fibroblasts. MiR-9 
      negatively modulated ANO1, and thus activated the TGF-beta-Smad3 pathway. These 
      findings suggest that miR-9 can indirectly activate the TGF-beta-Smad3 pathway by 
      inhibiting the expression of ANO1, thereby aggravating inflammation, promotes 
      proliferation and suppressing apoptosis of lung fibroblasts in mice models of 
      IPF.

TI  - Impaired autophagic activity and ATG4B deficiency are associated with increased 
      endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced lung injury.
PG  - 2098-2112
LID - 10.18632/aging.101532 [doi]
AB  - Aging is the main risk factor for the development of idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF), a progressive and usually lethal lung disorder. Although the 
      pathogenic mechanisms are uncertain, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and 
      impaired proteostasis that have been linked with aging are strongly associated 
      with the pathogenesis of IPF. Using the Atg4b-deficient mice as a model, that 
      partially reproduces the autophagy deficient conditions reported in aging and IPF 
      lungs, we show for the first time how autophagy impairment and ER stress 
      induction, contribute simultaneously to development of lung fibrosis in vivo. 
      Increased expression of ER stress markers, inflammation and apoptosis of alveolar 
      epithelial cells were observed in Atg4b-deficient mice compared to WT mice, when 
      treated with the ER stress inducer tunicamycin. After tunicamycin treatment, 
      Atg4b null lungs showed accumulation of its substrate LC3-I, demonstrating that 
      these mice failed to induce autophagy despite the ER stress conditions. We also 
      showed that compromised autophagy in lungs from Atg4b null mice is associated 
      with exacerbated lung damage, epithelial apoptosis and the development of lung 
      fibrosis at 21 days after tunicamycin treatment. Our findings indicate that ATG4B 
      protein and autophagy are essential to mitigate ER stress and to prevent 
      tunicamycin-induced epithelial apoptosis and lung fibrosis.

AB  - Mechanisms of injury and repair in alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) are 
      critically involved in the progression of various lung diseases including 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Homeobox only protein x (HOPX) contributes 
      to the formation of distal lung during development. In adult lung, alveolar 
      epithelial type (AT) I cells express HOPX and lineage-labeled Hopx+ cells give 
      rise to both ATI and ATII cells after pneumonectomy. However, the cell function 
      of HOPX-expressing cells in adult fibrotic lung diseases has not been 
      investigated. In this study, we have established a flow cytometry-based method to 
      evaluate HOPX-expressing cells in the lung. HOPX expression in cultured ATII 
      cells increased over culture time, which was accompanied by a decrease of 
      proSP-C, an ATII marker. Moreover, HOPX expression was increased in AECs from 
      bleomycin-instilled mouse lungs in vivo. Small interfering RNA-based knockdown of 
      Hopx resulted in suppressing ATII-ATI trans-differentiation and activating 
      cellular proliferation in vitro. In IPF lungs, HOPX expression was decreased in 
      whole lungs and significantly correlated to a decline in lung function and 
      progression of IPF. In conclusion, HOPX is upregulated during early alveolar 
      injury and repair process in the lung. Decreased HOPX expression might contribute 
      to failed regenerative processes in end-stage IPF lungs.

AB  - Oxidative stress is considered to involve cell death in severe pulmonary diseases 
      like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Polysaccharide FMP-1 from Morchella 
      esculenta can exert significant antioxidant activity. However, its effects on 
      alveolar epithelial cells remain unperceived. Herein, the effects of FMP-1 
      against H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative damage in human alveolar epithelial A549 cells 
      were investigated. FMP-1 could inhibit H(2)O(2)-induced cytochrome C and 
      Caspase-3 release to prevent cell apoptosis via attenuation of MDA and ROS 
      levels, and enhancement the enzymatic activities of SOD and T-AOC. Furthermore, 
      the underlying molecular mechanisms were clarified. The phosphorylation of AKT 
      and the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 were observed to be promoted by FMP-1 as 
      well as the level of HO-1. These findings suggested that FMP-1 attenuate cellular 
      oxidative stress through PI3K/AKT pathway, and FMP-1 could be explored as natural 
      potential antioxidants to lower oxidative stress relevant to the progression of 
      IPF.

TI  - Inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling suppresses myofibroblast differentiation of 
      lung resident mesenchymal stem cells and pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 13644

AB  - An emerging paradigm proposes a crucial role for lung resident mesenchymal stem 
      cells (LR-MSCs) via a fibroblastic transdifferentiation event in the pathogenesis 
      of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Aberrant activation of Wnt/beta-catenin 
      signaling occurs in virtually all fibrotic lung diseases and is relevant to the 
      differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). In vitro, by measuring the 
      protein levels of several key components involved in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, we 
      confirmed that this signaling pathway was activated in the myofibroblast 
      differentiation of LR-MSCs. Targeted inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling by a 
      small molecule, ICG-001, dose-dependently impeded the proliferation and 
      transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1)-mediated fibrogenic actions of LR-MSCs. In 
      vivo, ICG-001 exerted its lung protective effects after bleomycin treatment 
      through blocking mesenchymal-myofibroblast transition, repressing matrix gene 
      expression, and reducing cell apoptosis. Moreover, delayed administration of 
      ICG-001 attenuated bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, which may present a promising 
      therapeutic strategy for intervention of IPF. Interestingly, these antifibrotic 
      actions of ICG-001 are operated by a mechanism independent of any disruption of 
      Smad activation. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that Wnt/beta-catenin 
      signaling may be an essential mechanism underlying the regulation of 
      myofibroblast differentiation of LR-MSCs and their further participation in the 
      development of pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - The pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the pathologic fibrosis in diseases such 
      as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are poorly understood. To identify genetic 
      factors affecting susceptibility to IPF, we analyzed a murine genetic model of 
      IPF in which a profibrotic cytokine (TGF-beta1) was expressed in the lungs of 10 
      different inbred mouse strains. Surprisingly, the extent of TGF-beta1-induced lung 
      fibrosis was highly strain dependent. Haplotype-based computational genetic 
      analysis and gene expression profiling of lung tissue obtained from 
      fibrosis-susceptible and -resistant strains identified laminin alpha1 (Lama1) as a 
      genetic modifier for susceptibility to IPF. Subsequent studies demonstrated that 
      Lama1 plays an important role in multiple processes that affect the pulmonary 
      response to lung injury and susceptibility to fibrosis, which include: macrophage 
      activation, fibroblast proliferation, myofibroblast transformation, and the 
      production of extracellular matrix. Also, Lama1 mRNA expression was significantly 
      increased in lung tissue obtained from IPF patients. These studies identify Lama1 
      as the genetic modifier of TGF-beta1 effector responses that significantly affects 
      the development of pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a debilitating, incurable, and 
      life-threatening disease. A cardinal feature of the pathogenesis of IPF is 
      excessive extracellular matrix deposition attributable to proliferation of 
      activated fibrotic lung fibroblasts (fLfs). To assess the underlying mechanism, 
      we analyzed the status of the tumor suppressor protein p53 in fLfs from the lungs 
      of IPF patients or mice with bleomycin-induced established PF. We report that 
      basal expression of p53 is markedly reduced in fLfs. Forced expression of 
      caveolin-1 in fLfs increased basal p53 and reduced profibrogenic proteins, 
      including collagen-1. Transduction of fLfs with adenovirus expressing p53 reduced 
      expression of these proteins. Conversely, inhibition of baseline p53 in control 
      lung fibroblasts from lung tissues increased profibrogenic protein expression. 
      Lung transduction of adenovirus expressing p53 reduced bleomycin-induced PF in 
      wild-type or caveolin-1-deficient mice. Furthermore, treatment of fLfs or 
      fibrotic lung tissues with caveolin-1 scaffolding domain peptide (CSP) or its 
      fragment, CSP7, restored p53 and reduced profibrogenic proteins. Treatment of 
      wild-type mice with i.p. CSP or CSP7 resolved bleomycin-induced PF. These 
      peptides failed to resolve PF in inducible conditional knockout mice lacking p53 
      in fLfs, indicating the induction of baseline fLf p53 as the basis of the 
      antifibrotic effects.

      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disease for 
      which age is the most important risk factor. Different mechanisms associated with 
      aging, including stem cell dysfunction, have been described to participate in the 
      pathophysiology of IPF. We observed an extrapulmonary effect associated with IPF: 
      increase in cell senescence of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells 
      (B-MSCs). METHODS: B-MSCs were obtained from vertebral bodies procured from IPF 
      patients and age-matched normal controls. Cell senescence was determined by cell 
      proliferation and expression of markers of cell senescence p16(INK4A), p21, and 
      beta-galactosidase activity. Mitochondrial function and DNA damage were measured. 
      Paracrine induction of senescence and profibrotic responses were analyzed in 
      vitro using human lung fibroblasts. The reparative capacity of B-MSCs was 
      examined in vivo using the bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis model. RESULTS: In our 
      study, we demonstrate for the first time that B-MSCs from IPF patients are 
      senescent with significant differences in mitochondrial function, with 
      accumulation of DNA damage resulting in defects in critical cell functions when 
      compared with age-matched controls. Senescent IPF B-MSCs have the capability of 
      paracrine senescence by inducing senescence in normal-aged fibroblasts, 
      suggesting a possible link between senescent B-MSCs and the late onset of the 
      disease. IPF B-MSCs also showed a diminished capacity to migrate and were less 
      effective in preventing fibrotic changes observed in mice after bleomycin-induced 
      injury, increasing illness severity and proinflammatory responses. CONCLUSIONS: 
      We describe extrapulmonary alterations in B-MSCs from IPF patients. The 
      consequences of having senescent B-MSCs are not completely understood, but the 
      decrease in their ability to respond to normal activation and the risk of having 
      a negative impact on the local niche by inducing inflammation and senescence in 
      the neighboring cells suggests a new link between B-MSC and the onset of the 
      disease.

TI  - The pathogenetic mechanisms of cough in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 39-43
LID - 10.1007/s11739-018-1960-5 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a peripheral subpleural interstitial lung 
      disorder limited to the lung not involving the airways. It has a poor prognosis 
      (survival less than 5 years) and commonly an interstitial pneumonia radiological 
      pattern. Patients complain of a chronic dry cough in 80% of cases. A cough is 
      often the first symptom of this rare disease, preceding dyspnea by years, and is 
      associated with a poor prognosis, high dyspnea scores and low FVC percentages. 
      The pathogenetic mechanisms leading to coughing in IPF are unclear. This review 
      focuses on recent evidence of cough pathophysiology in this disease. 
      Gastroesophageal reflux may promote coughing in IPF patients; bile salts and 
      pepsin may be abundant in BAL of these patients, inducing overproduction of TGF-beta 
      by airway epithelial cells and mesenchymal transition with fibroblast 
      recruitment/activation and extracellular matrix deposition. Patients have an 
      enhanced cough reflex to capsaicin and substance P with respect to control 
      subjects. Moreover, patients with the MUC5B polymorphism show more severe 
      coughing as MUC5B encodes for the dominant mucin in the honeycomb cysts of IPF 
      patients. Comorbidities, including asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, 
      hypersensitivity pneumonitis, bronchiectasis, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
      disease and emphysema, can induce coughing in IPF patients. There is no clear 
      explanation of the causes of coughing in IPF. Further research into the 
      pathophysiology of IPF and the pathogenetic mechanisms of coughing is necessary 
      to improve survival and quality of life.

TI  - Potential regulatory role of circular RNA in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 3256-3268
LID - 10.3892/ijmm.2018.3892 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive type of 
      interstitial pneumonia with unknown causes, poor prognosis and no effective 
      therapy available. Circular RNAs (circRNAs), which serve as potential therapeutic 
      targets and diagnostic biomarkers for certain diseases, represent a recent 
      hotspot in the field of RNA research. In the present study, a total of 
      67 significantly dysregulated circRNAs were identified in the plasma of IPF 
      patients by using a circRNA microarray. Among these circRNAs, 38 were 
      upregulated, whereas 29 were downregulated. Further validation of the results by 
      polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated that Homo sapiens 
      (hsa)_circRNA_100906, hsa_circRNA_102100 and hsa_circRNA_102348 were 
      significantly upregulated, whereas hsa_circRNA_101225, hsa_circRNA_104780 and 
      hsa_circRNA_101242 were downregulated in plasma samples of IPF patients compared 
      with those in samples from healthy controls. The majority of differentially 
      expressed circRNAs were generated from exonic regions. The host genes of the 
      differentially expressed circRNAs were involved in the regulation of the cell 
      cycle, adherens junctions and RNA transport. The competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) 
      network of the circRNAs/micro(mi)RNAs/mRNAs indicated that circRNA‑protected mRNA 
      participated in transforming growth factor‑beta1, hypoxia‑inducible factor‑1, Wnt, 
      Janus kinase, Rho‑associated protein kinase, vascular endothelial growth factor, 
      mitogen‑activated protein kinase, Hedgehog and nuclear factor kappaB signalling 
      pathways or functioned as biomarkers for pulmonary fibrosis. Furthermore, 
      luciferase reporter assays confirmed that hsa_circRNA_100906 and 
      hsa_circRNA_102348 directly interact with miR‑324‑5p and miR‑630, respectively, 
      which were downregulated in IPF patients. The present study provided a novel 
      avenue for exploring the underlying molecular mechanisms of IPF disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The abnormal shortening of telomeres is a mechanism 
      linking ageing to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) that could be useful in the 
      clinical setting. The objective of this study was to identify the IPF patients 
      with higher risk for telomere shortening and to investigate the outcome 
      implications. METHODS: Consecutive Spanish patients were included at diagnosis 
      and followed up for 3 years. DNA blood samples from a Mexican cohort were used to 
      validate the results found in Spanish sporadic IPF. Prior to treatment, telomere 
      length was measured through quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and 
      Southern blot. Outcome was assessed according to mortality or need for lung 
      transplantation. A multivariate regression logistic model was used for 
      statistical analysis. RESULTS: Family aggregation, age of <60 years and the 
      presence of non-specific immunological or haematological abnormalities were 
      associated with a higher probability of telomere shortening. Overall, 66.6% of 
      patients younger than 60 years with telomere shortening died or required lung 
      transplantation, independent of functional impairment at diagnosis. By contrast, 
      in patients older than 60 years with telomere shortening, the negative impact of 
      telomere shortening in outcome was not significant. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate 
      that young sporadic IPF patients (<60 years) with some non-specific immunological 
      or haematological abnormalities had higher risk of telomere shortening, and 
      furthermore, they presented a poorer prognosis.

TI  - IL-17A contributes to HSV1 infection-induced acute lung injury in a mouse model 
      of pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 908-919
LID - 10.1111/jcmm.13992 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) often experience 
      acute exacerbation (AE) after an episode of common cold. AIMS: To establish a 
      mouse model of virus infection-induced AE-IPF and investigate the mechanism 
      underlying the AE-IPF. METHODS: Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) was inoculated 
      intranasally to wild-type (WT) and IL-17A gene knockout (IL-17A(-/-) ) mice 
      21 days after intratracheal administration of bleomycin (BLM). RESULTS: HSV1 
      infection caused acute exacerbation in mice with BLM-induced fibrosis. Compared 
      with the BLM+Saline mice, the mice with BLM+HSV1 showed significantly higher 
      acute lung injury (ALI) score (P < 0.0001), lower survival rate (100% vs 21.4%, 
      P < 0.0001), poorer lung function and higher inflammatory response representing 
      by increased total inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) 
      (P = 0.0323), increased proportion of Th17 cells in peripheral blood (P = 0.0004) 
      and higher inflammatory factors in BALF. In addition, HSV1 infection increased 
      the expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-related proteins in mice 
      with BLM-induced fibrosis. The inhibition of ERS by tauroursodeoxycholic acid 
      (TUDCA, an ERS inhibitor) significantly reduced the IL-17A levels in BALF 
      (P = 0.0140) and TH17 cells in the peripheral blood (P = 0.0084) of mice with 
      BLM+HSV1, suggesting that suppression of ERS may reduce TH17 response in mice 
      with AE-IPF. Compared with WT mice with BLM+HSV1, IL-17A(-/-) mice with BLM+HSV1 
      had lower ALI score (P = 0.0119), higher survival rate (78.6% vs 21.4%, 
      P = 0.004), improved lung function, and milder inflammatory response. 
      CONCLUSIONS: HSV1 infection in addition to BLM-induced IPF can successfully 
      establish AE-IPF in mice. IL-17A and ERS promote lung inflammation in AE-IPF 
      development.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is localized to the lung, is characterized by 
      a pattern of heterogeneous, subpleural patches of fibrotic, remodeled lung, and 
      is associated with a median survival of 3-5 years after diagnosis. A common 
      gain-of-function MUC5B promoter variant, rs35705950, is the strongest risk factor 
      (genetic and otherwise), accounting for at least 30% of the total risk of 
      developing IPF. The MUC5B promoter variant can be used to identify individuals in 
      the preclinical phase of this progressive disease, and, in the IPF lung, we have 
      found that MUC5B is specifically overexpressed in bronchoalveolar epithelium. 
      Thus, MUC5B represents a key molecule to understand the mechanisms that appear to 
      initiate the fibroproliferative process in the bronchoalveolar epithelium. 
      Moreover, focusing on MUC5B may provide a unique opportunity to define the early 
      molecular events that lead to, and potentially prevent, the development of IPF.

TI  - The Role of TGF-beta Signaling in Lung Cancer Associated with Idiopathic Pulmonary 
      Fibrosis.
LID - 10.3390/ijms19113611 [doi]
LID - 3611
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fibrotic lung disease of 
      unknown etiology and dismal prognosis. IPF patients are known to have an 
      increased risk of lung cancer and careful decision-making is required for the 
      treatment of lung cancer associated with IPF. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 
      signaling plays a central role in tissue fibrosis and tumorigenesis. 
      TGF-beta-mediated pathological changes that occur in IPF lung tissue may promote the 
      process of field cancerization and provide the microenvironment favorable to 
      cancer initiation and progression. This review summarizes the current knowledge 
      related to IPF pathogenesis and explores the molecular mechanisms that underlie 
      the occurrence of lung cancer in the background of IPF, with an emphasis on the 
      multifaceted effects of TGF-beta signaling.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal disease that destroys the 
      structure and function of the lungs. Risk factors include advanced age and 
      genetic predisposition. However, tobacco use is the chief modifiable risk factor. 
      The prevalence of tobacco use in IPF reaches up to 80%. Although tobacco smoke 
      contains over 5000 chemicals, nicotine is a major component. Nicotine is a 
      bioactive molecule that acts upon nicotinic acetylcholine receptors expressed on 
      neuronal and non-neuronal cells including endothelial cells. Accordingly, it has 
      a pleiotropic effect on cell proliferation and angiogenesis. The angiogenic 
      effect is partly mediated by stimulation of growth factors including fibroblast, 
      platelet-derived, and vascular endothelial growth factors. Nintedanib, a Food and 
      Drug Administration-approved drug for IPF, works by inhibiting receptors for 
      these growth factors, suggesting a pathobiologic role of the growth factors in 
      IPF and a potential mechanism by which tobacco use may exacerbate the disease 
      process; additionally, nicotine downregulates anti-inflammatory microRNAs (miRs) 
      in lung cells. Here, we profiled the expression of miRs in lung tissues explanted 
      from a lung injury model and examined the effect of nicotine on one of the 
      identified miRs (miR-24) and its downstream targets. Our data show that miR-24 is 
      downregulated during lung injury and is suppressed by nicotine. We also found 
      that nicotine upregulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines targeted by 
      miR-24. Finally, nicotine stimulated growth factors, fibroblast proliferation, 
      collagen release, and expression of myofibroblast markers. Taken together, 
      nicotine, alone or as a component of tobacco smoke, may accelerate the disease 
      process in IPF through stimulation of growth factors and downregulation of 
      anti-inflammatory miRs.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal disease, and 
      consequently, effective antifibrotic drugs are strongly desired. Although we have 
      previously reported a validated Col1a1-Luc Tg rat model for fibrosis, there are 
      only a few mouse models that enable the evaluation of fibrosis in a short time 
      period and with high sensitivity. Therefore, we generated a Col1a1-internal 
      ribosome entry site (IRES)-Luc knock-in (KI) mouse in which the IRES-luciferase 
      gene construct was inserted into the 3'-UTR of the type I collagen alpha 1 gene 
      (Col1a1). There was a high correlation between luciferase activity and 
      hydroxyproline content in the KI mice, which is similar to the result that we 
      have previously reported for the Col1a1-Luc Tg rat model. In a bleomycin 
      (BLM)-induced lung fibrosis model, luciferase activity in the lung showed a 
      significant increase 3 days after BLM treatment, while only a slight increase was 
      observed in the hydroxyproline content. An ALK-5 inhibitor-R-268712-was effective 
      in inhibiting the luciferase activity in both the in vivo BLM-induced lung 
      fibrosis model and in vitro primary mouse lung fibroblasts. This suggests that 
      fibroblasts are the major collagen-producing cells in lung fibrosis. In human 
      lung fibroblasts, TGF-beta stimulation induced alpha-smooth muscle actin as observed by 
      immunostaining, suggesting that myofibroblast transdifferentiation (MTD) plays an 
      important role in lung fibrosis. Together, these results indicated that ALK-5 
      inhibitors might affect lung fibrosis mainly via the inhibition of MTD. Thus, the 
      Col1a1-IRES-Luc KI mouse might be useful for the evaluation of antifibrotic 
      effects and their underlying mechanisms.

TI  - Lysyl Hydroxylase Inhibition by Minoxidil Blocks Collagen Deposition and Prevents 
      Pulmonary Fibrosis via TGF-beta(1)/Smad3 Signaling Pathway.
PG  - 8592-8601
LID - 10.12659/MSM.910761 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a deadly disease characterized 
      by excessive collagen in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the lungs. Collagen is 
      the primary protein component of the ECM. However, the exact mechanisms 
      underlying the formation and deposition of collagen in the ECM under normal and 
      pathological conditions remain unclear. Previous studies showed that lysyl 
      hydroxylase (LH) plays a crucial role in the formation of collagen. Minoxidil is 
      an FDA-approved anti-hypertensive agent that inhibits LH that reduces fibrosis. 
      In this study, we investigated the functional roles of LHs (LH1, LH2, and LH3) in 
      pulmonary fibrosis and the anti-fibrotic effects of minoxidil. MATERIAL AND 
      METHODS Patient serum samples were examined for their expression of 
      procollagen-lysine, 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenases (PLOD) 1-3, the genes encoding 
      LH 1-3. Mice with bleomycin (BLM 2.5 mg/kg)-induced pulmonary fibrosis were 
      administered a minoxidil solution (30 mg/kg) by oral gavage. RESULTS The PLOD 
      mRNA levels were significantly higher in the IPF patients than in the healthy 
      control subjects. Minoxidil suppressed the BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis in 
      vivo. These effects were associated with blocking TGF-beta(1)/Smad3 signal 
      transduction and attenuating the expression and activity of LHs, resulting in 
      decreased collagen formation, thus reducing the pulmonary fibrosis. The 
      anti-fibrotic effects of minoxidil may be mediated through competitive inhibition 
      of LHs activity, resulting in decreased pyridine cross-link formation and 
      collagen production and deposition. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study suggest 
      that LH represents a target to prevent or treat pulmonary fibrosis, and minoxidil 
      may provide an effective agent to inhibit LHs.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), characterized by irreversible scarring and 
      progressive destruction of the lung tissue, is one of the most common types of 
      idiopathic interstitial pneumonia worldwide. However, there are no reliable 
      candidates for curative therapies. Hence, elucidation of the mechanisms of IPF 
      genesis and exploration of potential biomarkers and prognostic indicators are 
      essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment of IPF. Recently, efficient 
      microarray and bioinformatics analyses have promoted an understanding of the 
      molecular mechanisms of disease occurrence and development, which is necessary to 
      explore genetic alternations and identify potential diagnostic biomarkers. 
      However, high false-positive rates results have been observed based on single 
      microarray datasets. In the current study, we performed a comprehensive analysis 
      of the differential expression, biological functions, and interactions of 
      IPF-related genes. Three publicly available microarray datasets including 54 IPF 
      samples and 34 normal samples were integrated by performing gene set enrichment 
      analysis and analyzing differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Our results 
      identified 350 DEGs genetically associated with IPF. Gene ontology analyses 
      revealed that the changes in the modules were mostly enriched in the positive 
      regulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation, positive regulation of 
      inflammatory responses, and the extracellular space. Kyoto encyclopedia of genes 
      and genomes enrichment analysis of DEGs revealed that IPF involves the TNF 
      signaling pathway, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, and PPAR signaling 
      pathway. To identify key genes related to IPF in the protein-protein interaction 
      network, 20 hub genes were screened out with highest scores. Our results provided 
      a framework for developing new pathological molecular networks related to 
      specific diseases in silico.

TI  - Pathogenic TERT promoter variants in telomere diseases.
PG  - 1594-1602
LID - 10.1038/s41436-018-0385-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The acquisition of pathogenic variants in the TERT promoter (TERTp) 
      region is a mechanism of tumorigenesis. In nonmalignant diseases, TERTp variants 
      have been reported only in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) due 
      to germline variants in telomere biology genes. METHODS: We screened patients 
      with a broad spectrum of telomeropathies (n = 136), their relatives (n = 52), and 
      controls (n = 195) for TERTp variants using a customized massively parallel 
      amplicon-based sequencing assay. RESULTS: Pathogenic -124 and -146 TERTp variants 
      were identified in nine (7%) unrelated patients diagnosed with IPF (28%) or 
      moderate aplastic anemia (4.6%); five of them also presented cirrhosis. Five 
      (10%) relatives were also found with these variants, all harboring a pathogenic 
      germline variant in telomere biology genes. TERTp clone selection did not 
      associate with peripheral blood counts, telomere length, and response to danazol 
      treatment. However, it was specific for patients with telomeropathies, more 
      frequently co-occurring with TERT germline variants and associated with aging. 
      CONCLUSION: We extend the spectrum of nonmalignant diseases associated with 
      pathogenic TERTp variants to marrow failure and liver disease due to inherited 
      telomerase deficiency. Specificity of pathogenic TERTp variants for telomerase 
      dysfunction may help to assess the pathogenicity of unclear constitutional 
      variants in the telomere diseases.

AB  - Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress of alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) is 
      recognized as a key event of cell dysfunction in pulmonary fibrosis (PF). 
      However, the mechanisms leading to AECs ER stress and ensuing unfolded protein 
      response (UPR) pathways in idiopathic PF (IPF) remain unclear. We hypothesized 
      that alveolar hypoxic microenvironment would generate ER stress and AECs 
      apoptosis through the hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha). Combining ex vivo, in 
      vivo and in vitro experiments, we investigated the effects of hypoxia on the UPR 
      pathways and ER stress-mediated apoptosis, and consecutively the mechanisms 
      linking hypoxia, HIF-1alpha, UPR and apoptosis. HIF-1alpha and the pro-apoptotic ER 
      stress marker C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) were co-expressed in hyperplastic 
      AECs from bleomycin-treated mice and IPF lungs, not in controls. Hypoxic exposure 
      of rat lungs or primary rat AECs induced HIF-1alpha, CHOP and apoptosis markers 
      expression. In primary AECs, hypoxia activated UPR pathways. Pharmacological ER 
      stress inhibitors and pharmacological inhibition or silencing of HIF-1alpha both 
      prevented hypoxia-induced upregulation of CHOP and apoptosis. Interestingly, 
      overexpression of HIF-1alpha in normoxic AECs increased UPR pathways transcription 
      factors activities, and CHOP expression. These results indicate that hypoxia and 
      HIF-1alpha can trigger ER stress and CHOP-mediated apoptosis in AECs, suggesting 
      their potential contribution to the development of IPF.

TI  - Interleukin-8 release by endothelial colony-forming cells isolated from 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients might contribute to their pathogenicity.
PG  - 325-339

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease 
      characterized by obliteration of alveolar architecture, resulting in declining 
      lung function and ultimately death. Pathogenic mechanisms involve a concomitant 
      accumulation of scar tissue together with myofibroblasts activation and a strong 
      abnormal vascular remodeling. Endothelial progenitor cells (ECFC subtype) have 
      been investigated in several human lung diseases as a potential actor in IPF. We 
      previously demonstrated that ECFCs are down-regulated in IPF in contrast to 
      healthy controls. We postulated here that ECFCs might behave as a liquid biopsy 
      in IPF patients and that they exert modified vasculogenic properties. METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: ECFCs isolated from controls and IPF patients expressed markers of the 
      endothelial lineage and did not differ concerning adhesion, migration, and 
      differentiation in vitro and in vivo. However, senescent and apoptotic states 
      were increased in ECFCs from IPF patients as shown by galactosidase staining, p16 
      expression, and annexin-V staining. Furthermore, conditioned medium of IPF-ECFCs 
      had increased level of interleukin-8 that induced migration of neutrophils in 
      vitro and in vivo. In addition, an infiltration by neutrophils was shown in IPF 
      lung biopsies and we found in a prospective clinical study that a high level of 
      neutrophils in peripheral blood of IPF patients was associated to a poor 
      prognosis. CONCLUSION: To conclude, our study shows that IPF patients have a 
      senescent ECFC phenotype associated with an increased IL-8 secretion potential 
      that might contribute to lung neutrophils invasion during IPF.

TI  - Senolytics in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: Results from a first-in-human, 
      open-label, pilot study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cellular senescence is a key mechanism that drives age-related 
      diseases, but has yet to be targeted therapeutically in humans. Idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, fatal cellular senescence-associated 
      disease. Selectively ablating senescent cells using dasatinib plus quercetin (DQ) 
      alleviates IPF-related dysfunction in bleomycin-administered mice. METHODS: A 
      two-center, open-label study of intermittent DQ (D:100 mg/day, Q:1250 mg/day, 
      three-days/week over three-weeks) was conducted in participants with IPF (n = 14) 
      to evaluate feasibility of implementing a senolytic intervention. The primary 
      endpoints were retention rates and completion rates for planned clinical 
      assessments. Secondary endpoints were safety and change in functional and 
      reported health measures. Associations with the senescence-associated secretory 
      phenotype (SASP) were explored. FINDINGS: Fourteen patients with stable IPF were 
      recruited. The retention rate was 100% with no DQ discontinuation; planned 
      clinical assessments were complete in 13/14 participants. One serious adverse 
      event was reported. Non-serious events were primarily mild-moderate, with 
      respiratory symptoms (n = 16 total events), skin irritation/bruising (n = 14), 
      and gastrointestinal discomfort (n = 12) being most frequent. Physical function 
      evaluated as 6-min walk distance, 4-m gait speed, and chair-stands time was 
      significantly and clinically-meaningfully improved (p < .05). Pulmonary function, 
      clinical chemistries, frailty index (FI-LAB), and reported health were unchanged. 
      DQ effects on circulat.ing SASP factors were inconclusive, but correlations were 
      observed between change in function and change in SASP-related matrix-remodeling 
      proteins, microRNAs, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (23/48 markers r >/= 0.50). 
      INTERPRETATION: Our first-in-humans open-label pilot supports study feasibility 
      and provides initial evidence that senolytics may alleviate physical dysfunction 
      in IPF, warranting evaluation of DQ in larger randomized controlled trials for 
      senescence-related diseases. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02874989 (posted 
      2016-2018).

AB  - This is a time of substantial progress in the evaluation and care of patients 
      with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). In addition to the approval and 
      widespread availability of the first IPF-specific therapies, there have been 
      improvements in imaging interpretation and lung biopsy methods to enable more 
      expeditious and more accurate diagnosis. Recent advances in identifying genetic 
      factors that underlie susceptibility to IPF and affect prognosis have raised the 
      possibility of personalized therapeutic approaches in the future. Further, 
      evolving work is elucidating novel mechanisms influencing epithelial, 
      mesenchymal, and inflammatory cell responses during the injury-repair process, 
      thus advancing understanding of disease pathogenesis. As analytic approaches 
      mature, the field is now poised to harness the power of rapidly advancing "omics" 
      technologies to further accelerate progress.

LID - 593
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most common idiopathic interstitial 
      pulmonary disease with a median survival of 2(-)4 years after diagnosis. A 
      significant number of IPF patients have risk factors, such as a history of 
      smoking or concomitant emphysema, both of which can predispose the patient to 
      lung cancer (LC) (mostly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)). In fact, IPF itself 
      increases the risk of LC development by 7% to 20%. In this regard, there are 
      multiple common genetic, molecular, and cellular processes that connect lung 
      fibrosis with LC, such as myofibroblast/mesenchymal transition, myofibroblast 
      activation and uncontrolled proliferation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, 
      alterations of growth factors expression, oxidative stress, and large genetic and 
      epigenetic variations that can predispose the patient to develop IPF and LC. The 
      current approved IPF therapies, pirfenidone and nintedanib, are also active in 
      LC. In fact, nintedanib is approved as a second line treatment in NSCLC, and 
      pirfenidone has shown anti-neoplastic effects in preclinical studies. In this 
      review, we focus on the current knowledge on the mechanisms implicated in the 
      development of LC in patients with IPF as well as in current IPF and LC-IPF 
      candidate therapies based on novel molecular advances.

TI  - MicroRNA-144-3p targets relaxin/insulin-like family peptide receptor 1 (RXFP1) 
      expression in lung fibroblasts from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 5008-5022
LID - 10.1074/jbc.RA118.004910 [doi]
AB  - The hormone relaxin is considered a potential therapy for idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF). We have previously shown that a potential limitation to 
      relaxin-based IPF therapy is decreased expression of a relaxin receptor, 
      relaxin/insulin-like family peptide receptor 1 (RXFP1), in IPF fibroblasts. The 
      mechanism that down-regulates RXFP1 in IPF remains unclear. To determine whether 
      microRNAs (miRs) regulate RXFP1 gene expression, here we employed a 
      bioinformatics approach to identify miRs predicted to target RXFP1 and identified 
      a putative miR-144-3p target site in the RXFP1 mRNA. In situ hybridization of IPF 
      lung biopsies revealed that miR-144-3p is expressed in fibroblastic foci. 
      Furthermore, we found that miR-144-3p is up-regulated in IPF fibroblasts compared 
      with lung fibroblasts from healthy donors. Transforming growth factor beta increased 
      miR-144-3p expression in both healthy and IPF lung fibroblasts in a SMAD family 
      2/3 (SMAD2/3)-dependent manner, and Jun proto-oncogene AP-1 transcription factor 
      subunit (AP-1) was required for constitutive miR-144-3p expression. 
      Overexpression of an miR-144-3p mimic significantly reduced RXFP1 mRNA and 
      protein levels and increased expression of the myofibroblast marker alpha-smooth 
      muscle actin (alpha-SMA) in healthy lung fibroblasts. IPF lung fibroblasts 
      transfected with anti-miR-144-3p had increased RXFP1 expression and reduced alpha-SMA 
      expression. Of note, a lentiviral luciferase reporter carrying the WT 3' UTR of 
      RXFP1 was significantly repressed in IPF lung fibroblasts, whereas a reporter 
      carrying a mutated miR-144-3p-binding site exhibited less sensitivity toward 
      endogenous miR-144-3p expression, indicating that miR-144-3p down-regulates RXFP1 
      in IPF lung fibroblasts by targeting its 3' UTR. We conclude that miR-144-3p 
      directly represses RXFP1 mRNA and protein expression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic cough is a difficult-to-treat comorbidity of idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and significantly impacts on the quality of life of 
      patients with IPF. Transient receptor potential (TRP) channel proteins may play 
      an important role in chronic cough. However, expression of these proteins in lung 
      of IPF is largely unknown. METHODS: Guinea pig model of pulmonary fibrosis was 
      established by single intratracheal delivery of bleomycin. Respiratory ungated 
      micro-CT scans were performed on days 7, 14, 21 and 28 to assess progression of 
      pulmonary fibrosis. Cough sensitivity to capsaicin was evaluated in conscious 
      animals on days 13 and 27. Real-time PCR (qPCR) and immunohistochemistry were 
      employed to measure expression of TRPV1 and TRPA1 in lung tissue. RESULTS: 
      Micro-CT showed that lung consolidation was detectable from day 7 distributing 
      mainly in the middle and lower lung fields, which was significantly correlated to 
      Ashcroft fibrosis score (r = 0.7993, p < 0.001). Cough sensitivity to capsaicin 
      in bleomycin-treated animals was significantly increased on days 13 and 27. qPCR 
      showed that expression of TRPV1 and TRPA1 was positively correlated each other 
      and significantly upregulated in lung tissues of model group compared with that 
      of controls, which was further supported by immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, 
      immunoreactivity for TRPV1 and TRPA1 was negatively correlated with Ashcroft 
      fibrosis score. CONCLUSION: Expression of TRPV1/TRPA1 was upregulated in the 
      chronic cough related to bleomycin induced pulmonary fibrosis in guinea pigs, 
      which provided new insights into the mechanism of IPF-associated cough 
      hypersensitivity. Micro-CT is very helpful methodology to access pulmonary 
      fibrosis progression in small animal models.

TI  - Bioinformatic analysis of next‑generation sequencing data to identify 
      dysregulated genes in fibroblasts of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 1643-1656
LID - 10.3892/ijmm.2019.4086 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal fibrotic lung disease with an 
      increasing global burden. It is hypothesized that fibroblasts have a number of 
      functions that may affect the development and progression of IPF. However, the 
      present understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with 
      fibroblasts in IPF remains limited. The present study aimed to identify the 
      dysregulated genes in IPF fibroblasts, elucidate their functions and explore 
      potential microRNA (miRNA)‑mRNA interactions. mRNA and miRNA expression profiles 
      were obtained from IPF fibroblasts and normal lung fibroblasts using a 
      next‑generation sequencing platform, and bioinformatic analyses were performed in 
      a step‑wise manner. A total of 42 dysregulated genes (>2 fold‑change of 
      expression) were identified, of which 5 were verified in the Gene Expression 
      Omnibus (GEO) database analysis, including the upregulation of neurotrimin (NTM), 
      paired box 8 (PAX8) and mesoderm development LRP chaperone, and the 
      downregulation of ITPR interacting domain containing 2 and Inka box actin 
      regulator 2 (INKA2). Previous data indicated that PAX8 and INKA2 serve roles in 
      cell growth, proliferation and survival. Gene Ontology analysis indicated that 
      the most significant function of these 42 dysregulated genes was associated with 
      the composition and function of the extracellular matrix (ECM). A total of 60 
      dysregulated miRNAs were also identified, and 1,908 targets were predicted by the 
      miRmap database. The integrated analysis of mRNA and miRNA expression data, 
      combined with GEO verification, finally identified Homo sapiens 
      (hsa)‑miR‑1254‑INKA2 and hsa‑miR‑766‑3p‑INKA2 as the potential miRNA‑mRNA 
      interactions in IPF fibroblasts. In summary, the results of the present study 
      suggest that dysregulation of PAX8, hsa‑miR‑1254‑INKA2 and hsa‑miR‑766‑3p‑INKA2 
      may promote the proliferation and survival of IPF fibroblasts. In the functional 
      analysis of the dysregulated genes, a marked association between fibroblasts and 
      the ECM was identified. These data improve the current understanding of 
      fibroblasts as key cells in the pathogenesis of IPF. As a screening study using 
      bioinformatics approaches, the results of the present study require additional 
      validation.

TI  - Lung Microbiota Contribute to Pulmonary Inflammation and Disease Progression in 
      Pulmonary Fibrosis.
PG  - 1127-1138
LID - 10.1164/rccm.201809-1650OC [doi]
AB  - Rationale: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) causes considerable global 
      morbidity and mortality, and its mechanisms of disease progression are poorly 
      understood. Recent observational studies have reported associations between lung 
      dysbiosis, mortality, and altered host defense gene expression, supporting a role 
      for lung microbiota in IPF. However, the causal significance of altered lung 
      microbiota in disease progression is undetermined. Objectives: To examine the 
      effect of microbiota on local alveolar inflammation and disease progression using 
      both animal models and human subjects with IPF. Methods: For human studies, we 
      characterized lung microbiota in BAL fluid from 68 patients with IPF. For animal 
      modeling, we used a murine model of pulmonary fibrosis in conventional and 
      germ-free mice. Lung bacteria were characterized using 16S rRNA gene sequencing 
      with novel techniques optimized for low-biomass sample load. Microbiota were 
      correlated with alveolar inflammation, measures of pulmonary fibrosis, and 
      disease progression. Measurements and Main Results: Disruption of the lung 
      microbiome predicts disease progression, correlates with local host inflammation, 
      and participates in disease progression. In patients with IPF, lung bacterial 
      burden predicts fibrosis progression, and microbiota diversity and composition 
      correlate with increased alveolar profibrotic cytokines. In murine models of 
      fibrosis, lung dysbiosis precedes peak lung injury and is persistent. In 
      germ-free animals, the absence of a microbiome protects against mortality. 
      Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that lung microbiota contribute to the 
      progression of IPF. We provide biological plausibility for the hypothesis that 
      lung dysbiosis promotes alveolar inflammation and aberrant repair. Manipulation 
      of lung microbiota may represent a novel target for the treatment of IPF.

AB  - Lung resident mesenchymal stem cells (LR-MSCs) contribute to the progression of 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We aimed to investigate the molecular 
      mechanism underlying LR-MSCs regulation upon transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 
      stimulation. We induced fibrogenic differentiation of LR-MSCs isolated from mice 
      by TGF-beta1. Several stem cell markers were detected by flow cytometric analysis. 
      Protein expression level was tested by Western blotting and mRNA level was 
      detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell 
      viability, proliferation and apoptosis were measured. TGF-beta1 promoted fibrogenic 
      differentiation of LR-MSCs and upregulated beta-catenin and p-glycogen synthase 
      kinase-3beta, suggesting the activation of Wnt signaling. MicroRNA (MiR)-124-3p was 
      significantly upregulated in TGF-beta1 treated LR-MSCs compared to untreated cells. 
      Intriguingly, silence of miR-124 reversed the TGF-beta1-induced changes in cell 
      viability and proliferation, and also led to a decrease of cell apoptosis. 
      Additionally, in miR-124 silenced cells, alpha-smooth muscle actin, collagen I and 
      fibronectin were downregulated compared to control cells. We ultimately 
      identified a new target of miR-124, AXIN1, which was repressed by miR-124. In 
      conclusion, miR-124 regulates AXIN1 to activate Wnt signaling and therefore plays 
      a crucial role in the TGF-beta1-induced fibrogenic differentiation.

TI  - NADPH oxidase-mediated induction of reactive oxygen species and extracellular 
      matrix deposition by insulin-like growth factor binding protein-5.
PG  - L644-L655
LID - 10.1152/ajplung.00106.2018 [doi]
AB  - Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-5 (IGFBP-5) induces production of the 
      extracellular matrix (ECM) components collagen and fibronectin both in vitro and 
      in vivo and is overexpressed in patients with fibrosing lung diseases, such as 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and systemic sclerosis (SSc). However, the 
      mechanism by which IGFBP-5 exerts its fibrotic effect is incompletely understood. 
      Recent reports have shown a substantial role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in 
      fibrosis; thus we hypothesized that IGFBP-5 induces production of ROS to mediate 
      the profibrotic process. In vitro analyses revealed that ROS production was 
      induced by recombinant and adenoviral vector-mediated IGFBP-5 (AdBP5) in a dose- 
      and time-dependent manner, regulated through MEK/ERK and JNK signaling, and 
      primarily mediated by NADPH oxidase (Nox). Silencing IGFBP-5 in SSc and IPF 
      fibroblasts reduced ROS production. The antioxidants diphenyleneiodonium and 
      N-acetylcysteine blocked IGFBP-5-stimulated ECM production in normal, SSc, and 
      IPF human primary lung fibroblasts. In murine fibroblasts lacking critical 
      components of the Nox machinery, AdBP5-stimulated ROS production and fibronectin 
      expression were reduced compared with wild-type fibroblasts. IGFBP-5 stimulated 
      transcriptional expression of Nox3 in human fibroblasts while selective knockdown 
      of Nox3 reduced ROS production by IGFBP-5. Thus IGFBP-5 mediates fibrosis through 
      production of ROS in a Nox-dependent manner.

TI  - Defining the Activated Fibroblast Population in Lung Fibrosis Using Single-Cell 
      Sequencing.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal lung disorder 
      driven by unrelenting extracellular matrix deposition. Fibroblasts are recognized 
      as the central mediators of extracellular matrix production in IPF; however, the 
      characteristics of the underlying fibroblast cell populations in IPF remain 
      poorly understood. Here, we use an unbiased single-cell RNA sequencing analysis 
      of a bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis model to characterize molecular 
      responses to fibrotic injury. Lung cells were isolated on Day 11 to capture 
      emerging fibrosis and gene expression was analyzed by three complementary 
      techniques, which, together, generated a 49-gene signature that defined an 
      activated subpopulation of fibroblasts. However, none of the identified genes 
      were specific to the activated cells or to the disease setting, implying that the 
      activated fibroblasts are not uniquely defined, but exhibit a similar, yet 
      amplified, gene expression pattern to control cells. Our findings have important 
      implications for fibrosis research, including: 1) defining myofibroblasts with 
      any single marker will fail to capture much of the underlying biology; 2) 
      fibroblast activation is poorly correlated with expression of transforming growth 
      factor-beta pathway genes; 3) single-cell analysis provides insight into the 
      mechanism of action of effective therapies (nintedanib); 4) early events in lung 
      fibrosis need not involve significant changes in fibroblast number; populations 
      that do increase in number, such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and 
      proliferating myeloid cells, may merit closer examination for their role in 
      pathogenesis.

PG  - 499-510
LID - 10.1007/s10495-019-01529-9 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a deadly and progressive fibrotic lung 
      disease, but the precise etiology remains elusive. IPF is characterized by the 
      presence of apoptosis-resistant (myo)fibroblasts that relentlessly produce a 
      collagen-rich extracellular matrix (ECM). Recent studies showed that an 
      anti-cancer chemotherapy drug cisplatin is implicated in the development of 
      pulmonary fibrosis, suggesting that the treatment of cancer patients with 
      cisplatin may alter fibroblast viability. To address this possibility, we 
      investigated the cisplatin-induced cell death mechanism in lung fibroblasts 
      derived from IPF and non-IPF patients in response to a collagen matrix. IPF 
      fibroblasts showed enhanced resistance to cisplatin-induced cell death compared 
      to non-IPF fibroblasts in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Molecular study 
      showed that the expression of gammaH2AX, PUMA and caspase-3/7 activity was abnormally 
      reduced in IPF fibroblasts, suggesting that DNA damage-induced apoptosis caused 
      by cisplatin was suppressed in IPF fibroblasts. Our study further revealed that 
      DNA repair protein XRCC1 activity was aberrantly increased as a result of CK2 
      hyper-activation in cisplatin-treated IPF fibroblasts, and this alteration 
      protected IPF fibroblasts from cisplatin-induced cell death. Our results showed 
      that IPF fibroblasts residing in a collagen rich matrix are resistance to 
      cisplatin-induced cell death due to the aberrantly high CK2/XRCC1-dependent DNA 
      repair activity. This finding suggests that pulmonary fibrosis may develop and 
      worsen due to the presence of apoptosis-resistant lung fibroblasts in 
      cisplatin-treated cancer patients.

TI  - [Rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease : new genetic data and 
      therapeutic perspectives].
PG  - 536-541
AB  - Diffuse interstitial lung disease (ILD) is one of the most frequent 
      extra-articular manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and is an important 
      factor of morbidity and mortality. However, the physiopathological mechanisms 
      underlying RA-associated ILD remain poorly understood, and disease management is 
      difficult in the absence of effective treatments and international guidelines. 
      The recent identification of genetic variants and mutations similar to those 
      observed in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a disease affecting exclusively 
      the lung, provides new insights into the understanding of RA-associated ILD. 
      Furthermore, new antifibrotic drugs approved for the treatment of IPF, including 
      pirfenidone and nintedanib, could also prove to be effective for RA-associated 
      ILD. Studies are ongoing to confirm this hypothesis.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal disease of unknown aetiology that 
      largely presents in the elderly. The mechanisms related to aging such as 
      fibroblast senescence have been strongly implicated in pathology of IPF. We have 
      previously demonstrated the protective effects of IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) 
      against bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis (PF) via inhibition of 
      epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. However, the role of IL-18 in fibroblast 
      senescence in PF is still unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
      effects of IL-18 on fibroblast senescence in the development of PF. We found that 
      SA-beta-gal positive cells, the proportion of cells in G1 phase, and expressions of 
      p21 and p53 were increased in primary lung fibroblasts isolated from 
      BLM-challenged mice, while the fibroblasts from IL-18BP-treated mice showed 
      decreased senescence propensity. We further demonstrated that IL-18 was 
      sufficient to trigger senescence of primary lung fibroblasts. The 
      senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) of fibroblasts treated with 
      IL-18 robustly stimulated a fibrotic phenotype in pulmonary fibroblasts. 
      Moreover, the expression of Klotho, an anti-senescence protein, was 
      down-regulated after IL-18 treatment in primary lung fibroblasts. Overexpression 
      of Klotho reversed the senescence and SASP induced by IL-18 in lung fibroblasts. 
      In summary, we reported for the first time that IL-18 promoted the lung 
      fibroblast senescence and SASP in PF through blocking Klotho pathway. Neutralize 
      IL-18 by IL-18BP exhibited antifibrotic effects partly by suppressing lung 
      fibroblast senescence in PF. It contributes to the growing evidence that IL-18 
      could be a therapeutic target for PF.

TI  - The Long Noncoding RNA DNM3OS Is a Reservoir of FibromiRs with Major Functions in 
      Lung Fibroblast Response to TGF-beta and Pulmonary Fibrosis.
PG  - 184-198
LID - 10.1164/rccm.201807-1237OC [doi]
AB  - Rationale: Given the paucity of effective treatments for idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF), new insights into the deleterious mechanisms controlling lung 
      fibroblast activation, the key cell type driving the fibrogenic process, are 
      essential to develop new therapeutic strategies. TGF-beta (transforming growth 
      factor-beta) is the main profibrotic factor, but its inhibition is associated with 
      severe side effects because of its pleiotropic role. Objectives: To determine if 
      downstream noncoding effectors of TGF-beta in fibroblasts may represent new 
      effective therapeutic targets whose modulation may be well tolerated. Methods: We 
      investigated the whole noncoding fraction of TGF-beta-stimulated lung fibroblast 
      transcriptome to identify new genomic determinants of lung fibroblast 
      differentiation into myofibroblasts. Differential expression of the long 
      noncoding RNA (lncRNA) DNM3OS (dynamin 3 opposite strand) and its associated 
      microRNAs (miRNAs) was validated in a murine model of pulmonary fibrosis and in 
      IPF tissue samples. Distinct and complementary antisense oligonucleotide-based 
      strategies aiming at interfering with DNM3OS were used to elucidate the role of 
      DNM3OS and its associated miRNAs in IPF pathogenesis. Measurements and Main 
      Results: We identified DNM3OS as a fibroblast-specific critical downstream 
      effector of TGF-beta-induced lung myofibroblast activation. Mechanistically, DNM3OS 
      regulates this process in trans by giving rise to three distinct profibrotic 
      mature miRNAs (i.e., miR-199a-5p/3p and miR-214-3p), which influence SMAD and 
      non-SMAD components of TGF-beta signaling in a multifaceted way. In vivo, we showed 
      that interfering with DNM3OS function not only prevents lung fibrosis but also 
      improves established pulmonary fibrosis. Conclusions: Pharmacological approaches 
      aiming at interfering with the lncRNA DNM3OS may represent new effective 
      therapeutic strategies in IPF.

TI  - XBP1S Regulates MUC5B in a Promoter Variant-Dependent Pathway in Idiopathic 
      Pulmonary Fibrosis Airway Epithelia.
PG  - 220-234
LID - 10.1164/rccm.201810-1972OC [doi]
AB  - Rationale: The goal was to connect elements of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
      (IPF) pathogenesis, including chronic endoplasmic reticulum stress in respiratory 
      epithelia associated with injury/inflammation and remodeling, distal airway mucus 
      obstruction and honeycomb cyst formation with accumulation of MUC5B (mucin 5B), 
      and associations between IPF risk and polymorphisms in the MUC5B promoter. 
      Objectives: To test whether the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor protein 
      ERN2 (ER-to-nucleus signaling 2) and its downstream effector, the spliced form of 
      XBP1S (X-box-binding protein 1), regulate MUC5B expression and differentially 
      activate the MUC5B promoter variant in respiratory epithelia. Methods: Primary 
      human airway epithelial (HAE) cells, transgenic mouse models, human IPF lung 
      tissues, and cell lines expressing XBP1S and MUC5B promoters were used to explore 
      relationships between the ERN2/XBP1S pathway and MUC5B. An inhibitor of the 
      pathway, KIRA6, and XBP1 CRISPR-Cas9 were used in HAE cells to explore 
      therapeutic potential. Measurements and Main Results: ERN2 regulated MUC5B and 
      MUC5AC mRNAs. Downstream XBP1S selectively promoted MUC5B expression in vitro and 
      in distal murine airway epithelia in vivo. XBP1S bound to the proximal region of 
      the MUC5B promoter and differentially upregulated MUC5B expression in the context 
      of the MUC5B promoter rs35705950 variant. High levels of ERN2 and XBP1S were 
      associated with excessive MUC5B mRNAs in distal airways of human IPF lungs. 
      Cytokine-induced MUC5B expression in HAE cells was inhibited by KIRA6 and XBP1 
      CRISPR-Cas9. Conclusions: A positive feedback bistable ERN2-XBP1S pathway 
      regulates MUC5B-dominated mucus obstruction in IPF, providing an unfolded protein 
      response-dependent mechanism linking the MUC5B promoter rs35705950 polymorphism 
      with IPF pathogenesis. Inhibiting ERN2-dependent pathways/elements may provide a 
      therapeutic option for IPF.

TI  - Knockdown of Long Noncoding RNA H19 Represses the Progress of Pulmonary Fibrosis 
      through the Transforming Growth Factor beta/Smad3 Pathway by Regulating MicroRNA 
      140.
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00143-19 [doi]
LID - e00143-19
AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in various human diseases. Recently, 
      H19 was reported to be upregulated in fibrotic rat lung and play a stimulative 
      role in bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. However, its 
      expression in human fibrotic lung tissues and mechanism of action remain unclear. 
      Here, our observations showed that H19 expression was significantly upregulated 
      and that of microRNA 140 (miR-140) was markedly reduced in pulmonary fibrotic 
      tissues from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients and transforming growth 
      factor beta1 (TGF-beta1)-induced HBE and A549 cells. Moreover, the expression of H19 
      was negatively correlated with the expression of miR-140 in IPF tissues. H19 
      knockdown attenuated TGF-beta1-induced pulmonary fibrosis in vitro Furthermore, 
      animal experiments showed that H19 knockdown attenuated BLM-induced pulmonary 
      fibrosis in mice. The study of molecular mechanisms showed that H19 functioned 
      via reduction of miR-140 expression by binding to miR-140. The increase of 
      miR-140 inhibited TGF-beta1-induced pulmonary fibrosis, and H19 upregulation 
      diminished the inhibitory effects of miR-140 on TGF-beta1-induced pulmonary 
      fibrosis, which was involved in the TGF-beta/Smad3 pathway. Taken together, our 
      findings showed that H19 knockdown attenuated pulmonary fibrosis via the 
      regulatory network of lncRNA H19-miR-140-TGF-beta/Smad3 signaling, and H19 and 
      miR-140 might represent therapeutic targets and early diagnostic and prognostic 
      biomarkers for patients with pulmonary fibrosis.

TI  - Exploring the cross-phenotype network region of disease modules reveals 
      concordant and discordant pathways between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
      and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 2352-2364
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddz069 [doi]
AB  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
      (IPF) are two pathologically distinct chronic lung diseases that are associated 
      with cigarette smoking. Genetic studies have identified shared loci for COPD and 
      IPF, including several loci with opposite directions of effect. The existence of 
      additional shared genetic loci, as well as potential shared pathobiological 
      mechanisms between the two diseases at the molecular level, remains to be 
      explored. Taking a network-based approach, we built disease modules for COPD and 
      IPF using genome-wide association studies-implicated genes. The two disease 
      modules displayed strong disease signals in an independent gene expression data 
      set of COPD and IPF lung tissue and showed statistically significant overlap and 
      network proximity, sharing 19 genes, including ARHGAP12 and BCHE. To uncover 
      pathways at the intersection of COPD and IPF, we developed a metric, 
      NetPathScore, which prioritizes the pathways of a disease by their network 
      overlap with another disease. Applying NetPathScore to the COPD and IPF disease 
      modules enabled the determination of concordant and discordant pathways between 
      these diseases. Concordant pathways between COPD and IPF included extracellular 
      matrix remodeling, Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and ALK 
      pathways, whereas discordant pathways included advanced glycosylation end product 
      receptor signaling and telomere maintenance and extension pathways. Overall, our 
      findings reveal shared molecular interaction regions between COPD and IPF and 
      shed light on the congruent and incongruent biological processes lying at the 
      intersection of these two complex diseases.

AB  - Idiopathic Pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is diagnosed as a life-threatening, 
      progressive and incurable lung disease characterized by accumulation of 
      extracellular matrix and myofibroblasts, resulting in the function degradation 
      and structural alterations in normal lung parenchyma. Notably, Pulmonary Fibrosis 
      has been considering as a difficult problem in clinical with high mortality and 
      effective treatment strategies. Rosavin, a benzylPropylene glycoside, is isolated 
      from Rhodiola rosea L., exhibiting nootropic, anti-depressant, anti-cancer, 
      anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activities. In this study, we attended to 
      elucidate the pharmacological activity of Rosavin for treatment of pulmonary 
      fibrosis induced by bleomycin in mice. The results indicated that Rosavin could 
      significantly ameliorate the lung index and Pathological structure of mice with 
      Pulmonary fibrosis by bleomycin-induced. Additionally, Rosavin could evidently 
      decreased inflammatory cells infiltration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and 
      pro-inflammatory cytokines expression in lung tissue specimens induced by 
      bleomycin. Rosavin could down-regulate the expression of hydroxyproline and 
      malondialdehyde and increased the activities of superoxide dismutase, glutathione 
      peroxidase in lung tissue. The expression of Nrf2 were increased, and the 
      expression of NF-kappaB p65, TGF-beta1 and alpha-SMA were inhibited. The findings revealed 
      the protective effects and the primary mechanism of rosavin on bleomycin-induced 
      pulmonary fibrosis, which provided a scientific foundation for Rosavin as a 
      promising candidate for Pulmonary fibrosis treatment.

TI  - Resequencing Study Confirms That Host Defense and Cell Senescence Gene Variants 
      Contribute to the Risk of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.
PG  - 199-208
LID - 10.1164/rccm.201810-1891OC [doi]
AB  - Rationale: Several common and rare genetic variants have been associated with 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a progressive fibrotic condition that is localized 
      to the lung. Objectives: To develop an integrated understanding of the rare and 
      common variants located in multiple loci that have been reported to contribute to 
      the risk of disease. Methods: We performed deep targeted resequencing (3.69 Mb of 
      DNA) in cases (n = 3,624) and control subjects (n = 4,442) across genes and 
      regions previously associated with disease. We tested for associations between 
      disease and 1) individual common variants via logistic regression and 2) groups 
      of rare variants via sequence kernel association tests. Measurements and Main 
      Results: Statistically significant common variant association signals occurred in 
      all 10 of the regions chosen based on genome-wide association studies. The 
      strongest risk variant is the MUC5B promoter variant rs35705950, with an odds 
      ratio of 5.45 (95% confidence interval, 4.91-6.06) for one copy of the risk 
      allele and 18.68 (95% confidence interval, 13.34-26.17) for two copies of the 
      risk allele (P = 9.60 x 10(-295)). In addition to identifying for the first time 
      that rare variation in FAM13A is associated with disease, we confirmed the role 
      of rare variation in the TERT and RTEL1 gene regions in the risk of IPF, and 
      found that the FAM13A and TERT regions have independent common and rare variant 
      signals. Conclusions: A limited number of common and rare variants contribute to 
      the risk of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in each of the resequencing regions, 
      and these genetic variants focus on biological mechanisms of host defense and 
      cell senescence.

TI  - Role of fibroblast growth factor 23 and klotho cross talk in idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis.
PG  - L141-L154
LID - 10.1152/ajplung.00246.2018 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive fibrosing 
      interstitial pneumonia that mainly affects the elderly. Several reports have 
      demonstrated that aging is involved in the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of 
      IPF. alpha-Klotho (KL) has been well characterized as an "age-suppressing" hormone 
      and can provide protection against cellular senescence and oxidative stress. In 
      this study, KL levels were assessed in human plasma and primary lung fibroblasts 
      from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF-FB) and in lung tissue from 
      mice exposed to bleomycin, which showed significant downregulation when compared 
      with controls. Conversely, transgenic mice overexpressing KL were protected 
      against bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. Treatment of human lung fibroblasts with 
      recombinant KL alone was not sufficient to inhibit transforming growth factor-beta 
      (TGF-beta)-induced collagen deposition and inflammatory marker expression. 
      Interestingly, fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a proinflammatory circulating 
      protein for which KL is a coreceptor, was upregulated in IPF and bleomycin lungs. 
      To our surprise, FGF23 and KL coadministration led to a significant reduction in 
      fibrosis and inflammation in IPF-FB; FGF23 administration alone or in combination 
      with KL stimulated KL upregulation. We conclude that in IPF downregulation of KL 
      may contribute to fibrosis and inflammation and FGF23 may act as a compensatory 
      antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory mediator via inhibition of TGF-beta signaling. 
      Upon restoration of KL levels, the combination of FGF23 and KL leads to 
      resolution of inflammation and fibrosis. Altogether, these data provide novel 
      insight into the FGF23/KL axis and its antifibrotic/anti-inflammatory properties, 
      which opens new avenues for potential therapies in aging-related diseases like 
      IPF.

AB  - RATIONALE: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fibrotic 
      interstitial lung disease, with high mortality. Currently, the aetiology and the 
      pathology of IPF are poorly understood, with both innate and adaptive responses 
      previously being implicated in the disease pathogenesis. Heat shock proteins 
      (Hsp) and antibodies to Hsp in patients with IPF have been suggested as 
      therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers, respectively. We aimed to study 
      the relationship between the expression of Hsp72 and anti-Hsp72 antibodies in the 
      BAL fluid and serum Aw disease progression in patients with IPF. METHODS: A novel 
      indirect ELISA to measure anti-Hsp72 IgG was developed and together with 
      commercially available ELISAs used to detect Hsp72 IgG, Hsp72 IgGAM, and Hsp72 
      antigen, in the serum and BALf of a cohort of IPF (n = 107) and other 
      interstitial lung disease (ILD) patients (n = 66). Immunohistochemistry was used 
      to detect Hsp72 in lung tissue. The cytokine expression from monocyte-derived 
      macrophages was measured by ELISA. RESULTS: Anti-Hsp72 IgG was detectable in the 
      serum and BALf of IPF (n = 107) and other ILDs (n = 66). Total immunoglobulin 
      concentrations in the BALf showed an excessive adaptive response in IPF compared 
      to other ILDs and healthy controls (p = 0.026). Immunohistochemistry detection of 
      C4d and Hsp72 showed that these antibodies may be targeting high expressing Hsp72 
      type II alveolar epithelial cells. However, detection of anti-Hsp72 antibodies in 
      the BALf revealed that increasing concentrations were associated with improved 
      patient survival (adjusted HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.45-0.85; p = 0.003). In vitro 
      experiments demonstrate that anti-Hsp72 complexes stimulate macrophages to 
      secrete CXCL8 and CCL18. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that intrapulmonary 
      anti-Hsp72 antibodies are associated with improved outcomes in IPF. These may 
      represent natural autoantibodies, and anti-Hsp72 IgM and IgA may provide a 
      beneficial role in disease pathogenesis, though the mechanism of action for this 
      has yet to be determined.

AB  - Cellular senescence is a key factor driving age-related diseases. Recent studies 
      have revealed that senescence-associated secretory phenotype, telomere attrition, 
      epigenetic changes, and mitochondrial autophagy damage may mediate the 
      pathogenesis of senescence-related idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Reducing 
      the level of cellular senescence or clearing senescent cells can down-regulate 
      the expression of fibrosis factors and alleviate the symptoms of IPF. In this 
      review, we outlined the role and mechanism of cellular senescence in IPF.

TI  - The profibrotic effect of downregulated Na,K‑ATPase beta1 subunit in alveolar 
      epithelial cells during lung fibrosis.
PG  - 273-280
LID - 10.3892/ijmm.2019.4201 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive interstitial lung 
      disease characterized by progressive lung scarring and excessive extracellular 
      matrix depositon. When stimulated, alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) are 
      aberrantly activated, the expression of profibrotic molecules is enhanced, and 
      lung fibrosis is promoted, but the mechanism for this is unclear. It has been 
      reported that a downregulation of the Na,K‑ATPase beta1 subunit in renal epithelial 
      cells is involved in renal fibrosis development, but the role of this protein in 
      lung fibrosis remains unknown. In the present study, the expression of the 
      Na,K‑ATPase beta1 subunit was revealed to be markedly decreased in AECs of patients 
      with IPF and a bleomycin‑induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse model. Treatment with 
      transforming growth factor beta‑1 led to significantly downregulation of the 
      Na,K‑ATPase beta1 subunit in lung adenocarcioma A549 cells. Furthermore, the 
      knockdown of the Na,K‑ATPase beta1 subunit in A549 cells resulted in the 
      upregulation of profibrotic molecules, activation of the neurogenic locus notch 
      homolog protein 1 and extracellular signal‑regulated kinase 1/2 signaling 
      pathways and induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress. These findings reveal 
      that the downregulation of the Na,K‑ATPase beta1 subunit enhances the expression of 
      profibrotic molecules in AECs and may contribute to IPF pathogenesis.

AB  - Abundant epidemiologic evidence supports an association between idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and lung cancer. Lung tumors in patients with IPF 
      develop preferentially in the periphery immediately adjacent to fibrotic areas, 
      with different histologic distribution and immunohistochemical features compared 
      with non-IPF-associated lung tumors. In this context, evidence indicates that IPF 
      and lung cancer share many pathogenic similarities including genetic and 
      epigenetic markers. It has been suggested that specific germline mutations 
      predispose toward both IPF and lung cancer, leading to imbalance between 
      oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes and ultimately carcinogenesis within 
      fibrotic lungs. Aberrant epigenetic regulation due to methylation, histone 
      modifications, and mainly deregulation of common noncoding RNAs represents a 
      possible pathogenic link between the two disease paradigms. Genetic and 
      epigenetic alterations lead to abnormal activation of common transduction 
      pathways, including Wnt/beta-catenin and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B, 
      mediating metaplasia and hyperproliferation in alveolar type II epithelial cells. 
      Cellular transformations in the mesenchymal phenotype represent a common link 
      between lung fibrosis and carcinogenesis. In this review we summarize current 
      data on common cellular and molecular pathogenic mechanisms between IPF and lung 
      cancer and highlight promising therapeutic targets for this disease combination.

TI  - Overexpression of TIM-3 in Macrophages Aggravates Pathogenesis of Pulmonary 
      Fibrosis in Mice.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive lung disorder and 
      lacks effective treatments because of unclear mechanisms. Aberrant function of 
      alveolar macrophages is directly linked to pulmonary fibrosis. Here, we show 
      TIM-3 (T-cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain-3), a key regulator of 
      macrophage function, aggravates pulmonary fibrosis. TIM-3 mRNA of patients with 
      IPF was analyzed based on the Gene Expression Omnibus and Array Express 
      databases. Lung pathology and profibrotic molecules were assessed in a bleomycin 
      (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis model using wild-type (WT) and TIM-3 transgenic 
      (TIM-3-TG) mice. Macrophage cells, RAW264.7, were then applied to investigate the 
      effect of macrophage TIM-3 under BLM exposure in vitro. Macrophage depletion and 
      adoptive-transfer experiments were finally performed to examine lung morphology 
      and profibrotic molecules. TIM-3 expression was increased both in patients with 
      IPF and in our BLM-induced mouse model. TIM-3-TG mice developed more serious 
      pathological changes in lung tissue and higher expressions of TGF-beta1 
      (transforming growth factor-beta1) and IL-10 than WT mice. After BLM treatment, 
      TGF-beta1 and IL-10 expression was significantly decreased in RAW264.7 cells after 
      TIM-3 knock-out, whereas it was increased in TIM-3-TG peritoneal macrophages. The 
      scores of pulmonary fibrosis in WT and TIM-3-TG mice were significantly reduced, 
      and there was no difference between them after macrophage depletion. Furthermore, 
      WT mice receiving adoptive macrophages from TIM-3-TG mice also had more serious 
      lung fibrosis and increased expression of TGF-beta1 and IL-10 than those receiving 
      macrophages from WT mice. Our findings revealed that overexpressed TIM-3 in 
      alveolar macrophages aggravated pulmonary fibrosis.

      Associated with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a life-threatening disease with 
      an unknown etiology. Gene expression microarray data have provided some insights 
      into the molecular mechanisms of IPF. This study aimed to identify key genes and 
      significant signaling pathways involved in IPF using bioinformatics analysis. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using 
      integrated analysis of gene expression data with a robust rank aggregation (RRA) 
      method. The Connectivity Map (CMAP) was used to identify gene-expression 
      signatures associated with IPF. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis 
      (WGCNA) was used to explore the functional modules involved in the pathogenesis 
      of IPF. RESULTS A total of 191 patients with IPF and 101 normal controls from six 
      genome-wide expression datasets were included. CMAP predicted several small 
      molecular agents as potential gene targets in IPF. Several functional modules 
      were detected that showed the highest correlation with IPF, including an 
      extracellular matrix (ECM) component, and a myeloid leukocyte migration and 
      activation component involved in the immune response. Hub genes were identified 
      in the key functional modules that might have a role in the progression of IPF. 
      CONCLUSIONS WGCNA was used to identify functional modules and hub genes involved 
      in the pathogenesis of IPF.

TI  - TAZ is required for lung alveolar epithelial cell differentiation after injury.

LID - e128674
AB  - The lung is a relatively quiescent organ during homeostasis, but has a remarkable 
      capacity for repair after injury. Alveolar epithelial type I cells (AEC1s) line 
      airspaces and mediate gas exchange. After injury, they are regenerated by 
      differentiation from their progenitors - alveolar epithelial type II cells 
      (AEC2s) - which also secrete surfactant to maintain surface tension and alveolar 
      patency. While recent studies showed that the maintenance of AEC2 stemness is Wnt 
      dependent, the molecular mechanisms underlying AEC2-AEC1 differentiation in adult 
      lung repair are still incompletely understood. Here we show that WWTR1 (TAZ) 
      plays a crucial role in AEC differentiation. Using an in vitro organoid culture 
      system, we found that tankyrase inhibition can efficiently block AEC2-AEC1 
      differentiation, and this effect was due to the inhibition of TAZ. In a bleomycin 
      induced lung injury model, conditional deletion of TAZ in AEC2s dramatically 
      reduced AEC1 regeneration during recovery, leading to exacerbated alveolar 
      lesions and fibrosis. In patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), 
      decreased blood levels of RAGE, a biomarker of AEC1 health, were associated with 
      more rapid disease progression. Our findings implicate TAZ as a critical factor 
      involved in AEC2 to AEC1 differentiation, and hence the maintenance of alveolar 
      integrity after injury.

LID - 1802441
AB  - A comprehensive understanding of the changes in gene expression in cell types 
      involved in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) will shed light on the mechanisms 
      underlying the loss of alveolar epithelial cells and development of honeycomb 
      cysts and fibroblastic foci. We sought to understand changes in IPF lung cell 
      transcriptomes and gain insight into innate immune aspects of pathogenesis.We 
      investigated IPF pathogenesis using single-cell RNA-sequencing of fresh lung 
      explants, comparing human IPF fibrotic lower lobes reflecting late disease, upper 
      lobes reflecting early disease and normal lungs.IPF lower lobes showed increased 
      fibroblasts, and basal, ciliated, goblet and club cells, but decreased alveolar 
      epithelial cells, and marked alterations in inflammatory cells. We found three 
      discrete macrophage subpopulations in normal and fibrotic lungs, one expressing 
      monocyte markers, one highly expressing FABP4 and INHBA (FABP4(hi)), and one 
      highly expressing SPP1 and MERTK (SPP1(hi)). SPP1(hi) macrophages in fibrotic 
      lower lobes showed highly upregulated SPP1 and MERTK expression. Low-level local 
      proliferation of SPP1(hi) macrophages in normal lungs was strikingly increased in 
      IPF lungs.Co-localisation and causal modelling supported the role for these 
      highly proliferative SPP1(hi) macrophages in activation of IPF myofibroblasts in 
      lung fibrosis. These data suggest that SPP1(hi) macrophages contribute 
      importantly to lung fibrosis in IPF, and that therapeutic strategies targeting 
      MERTK and macrophage proliferation may show promise for treatment of this 
      disease.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and generally lethal lung 
      disease with a high mortality rate. Current therapeutic drugs exhibit limited 
      efficacy but severe adverse effects. Paclitaxel has been identified to exert both 
      anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrosis activity. Baccatin III (BAC), an important 
      precursor of paclitaxel, has been identified as exhibiting immunomodulatory 
      activity with decisively lower toxicity. However, its effects on pulmonary 
      fibrosis remain unknown. In this study, the role of BAC in bleomycin 
      (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis and inflammation in mice was investigated in 
      addition to elucidation of its mechanism of action. Our results demonstrated that 
      administration of BAC in a dose-dependent manner reduced inflammatory 
      infiltration, secretion of the pro-fibrotic mediator TGF-beta1 and deposition of 
      collagen and other components of the extracellular matrix (ECM), including alpha 
      smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and fibronectin. Administration of BAC to treat 
      isolated macrophages stimulated with IL-13, known to activate macrophages, the 
      principal source of TGF-beta1, resulted in markedly reduced TGF-beta1 expression from 
      macrophages. The AKT/STAT6 signaling pathway was shown to be involved in this 
      process. In addition, we have provided in vitro evidence that BAC inhibits 
      TGF-beta1-induced fibroblast differentiation via the Smad2/3 signaling pathway. 
      Furthermore, intratracheal injection of rTGF-beta1 significantly exacerbated the 
      degree of fibrosis which was down-regulated by treatment with BAC. Taken 
      together, our data suggest that BAC exerts a protective effect against lung 
      fibrosis and may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for IPF.

TI  - LncRNA PFAR contributes to fibrogenesis in lung fibroblasts through competitively 
      binding to miR-15a.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive, debilitating 
      disease with unknown etiopathogenesis. Previous reports have reported that long 
      non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were involved in various pathophysiological processes. 
      However, the role of lncRNAs in IPF has not been fully described. We aimed to 
      explore the relationship between miR-15a and lncRNA PFAR and its function in 
      pulmonary fibrosis. Biological information analysis and luciferase were used to 
      identify targeted binding of lncRNA PFAR and miR-15a. Western blot, quantitative 
      reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunofluorescence staining were 
      conducted to detect fibrosis-related factors. Fibroblasts proliferation were 
      analyzed using 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining and fibroblasts migration 
      ability were measured using wound-healing scratch assay. We identified that 
      lncRNA PFAR has a binding site with miR-15a and luciferase reporter assays 
      demonstrated their combinative relationship. Our results showed that silencing 
      PFAR attenuated TGF-beta1 induced fibrogenesis in primary lung fibroblasts. And 
      miR-15a antagonized the function of PFAR and inhibited PFAR induced extracellular 
      collagen deposition, fibroblasts proliferation, migration and differentiation. In 
      conclusion, our results revealed that PFAR functions as a competitive endogenous 
      RNA (ceRNA) by acting as a sponge for miR-15a, revealing a potential regulatory 
      network involving PFAR and miR-15a with a role in the modulation of YAP1-Twist 
      expression. This mechanism may contribute to a better understanding of pulmonary 
      fibrosis pathogenesis and treatment method.

TI  - Metformin induces lipogenic differentiation in myofibroblasts to reverse lung 
      fibrosis.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal disease in which the intricate 
      alveolar network of the lung is progressively replaced by fibrotic scars. 
      Myofibroblasts are the effector cells that excessively deposit extracellular 
      matrix proteins thus compromising lung structure and function. Emerging 
      literature suggests a correlation between fibrosis and metabolic alterations in 
      IPF. In this study, we show that the first-line antidiabetic drug metformin 
      exerts potent antifibrotic effects in the lung by modulating metabolic pathways, 
      inhibiting TGFbeta1 action, suppressing collagen formation, activating PPARgamma 
      signaling and inducing lipogenic differentiation in lung fibroblasts derived from 
      IPF patients. Using genetic lineage tracing in a murine model of lung fibrosis, 
      we show that metformin alters the fate of myofibroblasts and accelerates fibrosis 
      resolution by inducing myofibroblast-to-lipofibroblast transdifferentiation. 
      Detailed pathway analysis revealed a two-arm mechanism by which metformin 
      accelerates fibrosis resolution. Our data report an antifibrotic role for 
      metformin in the lung, thus warranting further therapeutic evaluation.

LID - 9712464
AB  - BACKGROUND: Overexpression of the MUC5B protein is associated with idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), but little information is available regarding the 
      pathogenic effects and regulatory mechanisms of overexpressed MUC5B in IPF. MAIN 
      BODY: The overexpression of MUC5B in terminal bronchi and honeycomb cysts 
      produces mucosal host defensive dysfunction in the distal airway which may play 
      an important role in the development of IPF. This review addresses the possible 
      association of overexpression of MUC5B, with MUC5B promoter polymorphism, MUC5B 
      gene epigenetic changes, effects of some transcriptional factors, and 
      inflammatory mediators in IPF. In addition, the associated signaling pathways 
      which may influence the expression of MUC5B are also discussed. CONCLUSION: This 
      work has important implications for further exploration of the mechanisms of 
      overexpression of MUC5B in IPF, and future personalized treatment.

TI  - Fibulin-1c regulates transforming growth factor-beta activation in pulmonary tissue 
      fibrosis.
LID - 124529 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/jci.insight.124529 [doi]
LID - e124529
AB  - Tissue remodeling/fibrosis is a major feature of all fibrotic diseases, including 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). It is underpinned by accumulating 
      extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Fibulin-1c (Fbln1c) is a matricellular ECM 
      protein associated with lung fibrosis in both humans and mice, and stabilizes 
      collagen formation. Here we discovered that Fbln1c was increased in the lung 
      tissues of IPF patients and experimental bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. 
      Fbln1c-deficient (-/-) mice had reduced pulmonary remodeling/fibrosis and 
      improved lung function after bleomycin challenge. Fbln1c interacted with 
      fibronectin, periostin and tenascin-c in collagen deposits following bleomycin 
      challenge. In a novel mechanism of fibrosis Fbln1c bound to latent transforming 
      growth factor (TGF)-beta binding protein-1 (LTBP1) to induce TGF-beta activation, and 
      mediated downstream Smad3 phosphorylation/signaling. This process increased 
      myofibroblast numbers and collagen deposition. Fbln1 and LTBP1 co-localized in 
      lung tissues from IPF patients. Thus, Fbln1c may be a novel driver of 
      TGF-beta-induced fibrosis involving LTBP1 and may be an upstream therapeutic target.

TI  - Syndecan-1 promotes lung fibrosis by regulating epithelial reprogramming through 
      extracellular vesicles.
LID - 129359 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/jci.insight.129359 [doi]
LID - e129359
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and fatal lung disease. A 
      maladaptive epithelium due to chronic injury is a prominent feature and 
      contributor to pathogenic cellular communication in IPF. Recent data highlight 
      the concept of a "reprogrammed" lung epithelium as critical in the development of 
      lung fibrosis. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are potent mediator of cellular 
      crosstalk, and recent evidence supports their role in lung pathologies such as 
      IPF. Here, we demonstrate that syndecan-1 is overexpressed by the epithelium in 
      the lungs of IPF patients and in murine models after bleomycin injury. Moreover, 
      we find that syndecan-1 is a pro-fibrotic signal that alters alveolar type II 
      (ATII) cell phenotypes by augmenting TGFbeta and Wnt signaling among other 
      pro-fibrotic pathways. Importantly, we demonstrate that syndecan-1 controls the 
      packaging of several anti-fibrotic microRNAs into EVs that have broad effects 
      over several fibrogenic signaling networks as a mechanism of regulating 
      epithelial plasticity and pulmonary fibrosis. Collectively, our work reveals new 
      insight into how EVs orchestrate cellular signals that promote lung fibrosis and 
      demonstrate the importance of syndecan-1 in coordinating these programs.

TI  - Protective effect of bicyclol against pulmonary fibrosis via regulation of 
      microRNA-455-3p in rats.
PG  - 651-660
LID - 10.1002/jcb.29310 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a chronic, progressive and irreversible 
      disease, needs long-term treatment. Bicyclol was found to play a great role in 
      pulmonary fibrosis, and the present study is to explore how bicyclol affects IPF 
      with the involvement of microRNA-455-3p (miR-455-3p) and Bax. Bleomycin (BLM) was 
      used to induce the IPF model in Sprague-Dawley rats to detect the expression of 
      miR-455-3p, Bax, and B-cell lymphoma factor 2 (Bcl-2). Moreover, to further 
      investigate the mechanisms of bicyclol, the BLM-induced fibrotic cell model was 
      used after the lung epithelial cells HPAEpiC received miR-455-3p knockout 
      treatment. The rats were then treated with vehicle and bicyclol, respectively. 
      The apoptosis of fibrotic cells and Bax/Bcl-2 were identified. Inhibition 
      function of bicyclol was optimal at a dose of 150 mg/kg. Bicyclol inhibited cell 
      apoptosis and reduced Bax/Bcl-2 expression in rats. miR-455-3p could potentially 
      bind to Bax gene. Bicyclol reduced the levels of methylenedioxyamphetamine, 
      superoxide dismutase, and glutathione in rat lung tissue, inhibited the apoptosis 
      of rats with IPF and upregulated miR-455-3p expression. In vitro studies showed 
      that bicyclol significantly promoted miR-455-3p expression in HPAEpiC fibrosis. 
      Bicyclol inhibited fibrosis-induced apoptosis of HPAEpiC in alveolar epithelial 
      cells through promoting miR-455-3p, which inhibited Bax expression in IPF. 
      Bicyclol may suppress the apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells by upregulating 
      miR-455-3p. This study laid a theoretical foundation for further understanding of 
      IPF and searching for new molecular therapeutic targets.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies have highlighted the contribution of senescent 
      mesenchymal and epithelial cells in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), but 
      little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms that regulate the accumulation 
      of senescent cells in this disease. Therefore, we addressed the hypothesis that 
      the loss of DNA repair mechanisms mediated by DNA protein kinase catalytic 
      subunit (DNA-PKcs) in IPF, promoted the accumulation of mesenchymal progenitors 
      and progeny, and the expression of senescent markers by these cell types. 
      METHODS: Surgical lung biopsy samples and lung fibroblasts were obtained from 
      patients exhibiting slowly, rapidly or unknown progressing IPF and lung samples 
      lacking any evidence of fibrotic disease (i.e. normal; NL). The expression of 
      DNA-Pkcs in lung tissue was assessed by quantitative immunohistochemical 
      analysis. Chronic inhibition of DNA-PKcs kinase activity was mimicked using a 
      highly specific small molecule inhibitor, Nu7441. Proteins involved in DNA repair 
      (stage-specific embryonic antigen (SSEA)-4(+) cells) were determined by 
      quantitative Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of transcriptomic datasets (GSE103488). 
      Lastly, the loss of DNA-PKc was modeled in a humanized model of pulmonary 
      fibrosis in NSG SCID mice genetically deficient in PRKDC (the transcript for 
      DNA-PKcs) and treated with Nu7441. RESULTS: DNA-PKcs expression was significantly 
      reduced in IPF lung tissues. Chronic inhibition of DNA-PKcs by Nu7441 promoted 
      the proliferation of SSEA4(+) mesenchymal progenitor cells and a significant 
      increase in the expression of senescence-associated markers in cultured lung 
      fibroblasts. Importantly, mesenchymal progenitor cells and their fibroblast 
      progeny derived from IPF patients showed a loss of transcripts encoding for DNA 
      damage response and DNA repair components. Further, there was a significant 
      reduction in transcripts encoding for PRKDC (the transcript for DNA-PKcs) in 
      SSEA4(+) mesenchymal progenitor cells from IPF patients compared with normal lung 
      donors. In SCID mice lacking DNA-PKcs activity receiving IPF lung explant cells, 
      treatment with Nu7441 promoted the expansion of progenitor cells, which was 
      observed as a mass of SSEA4(+) CgA(+) expressing cells. CONCLUSIONS: Together, 
      our results show that the loss of DNA-PKcs promotes the expansion of SSEA4(+) 
      mesenchymal progenitors, and the senescence of their mesenchymal progeny.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic disease characterized by the 
      pathological remodeling of air sacs as a result of excessive accumulation of 
      extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, but the mechanism governing the robust 
      protein expression is poorly understood. Our recent findings demonstrate that 
      alternative polyadenylation (APA) caused by NUDT21 reduction is important for the 
      increased expression of fibrotic mediators and ECM proteins in lung fibroblasts 
      by shortening the 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) of mRNAs and stabilizing 
      their transcripts, therefore activating pathological signaling pathways. Despite 
      the importance of NUDT21 reduction in the regulation of fibrosis, the underlying 
      mechanisms for the depletion are unknown. We demonstrate here that NUDT21 is 
      depleted by TGFbeta1. We found that miR203, which is increased in IPF, was induced 
      by TGFbeta1 to target the NUDT21 3'-UTR, thus depleting NUDT21 in human and mouse 
      lung fibroblasts. TGFbeta1-mediated NUDT21 reduction was attenuated by the miR203 
      inhibitor antagomiR203 in fibroblasts. TGFbeta1 transgenic mice revealed that TGFbeta1 
      down-regulates NUDT21 in fibroblasts in vivo Furthermore, TGFbeta1 promoted 
      differential APA of fibrotic genes, including FGF14, RICTOR, TMOD2, and UCP5, in 
      association with increased protein expression. This unique differential APA 
      signature was also observed in IPF fibroblasts. Altogether, our results 
      identified TGFbeta1 as an APA regulator through NUDT21 depletion amplifying 
      pulmonary fibrosis.

TI  - Cross-Talk between Transforming Growth Factor-beta and Periostin Can Be Targeted for 
      Pulmonary Fibrosis.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease characterized as 
      progressive and irreversible fibrosis in the interstitium of lung tissues. There 
      is still an unmet need to develop a novel therapeutic drug for IPF. We have 
      previously demonstrated that periostin, a matricellular protein, plays an 
      important role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. However, the underlying 
      mechanism of how periostin causes pulmonary fibrosis remains unclear. In this 
      study, we sought to learn whether the cross-talk between TGF-beta (transforming 
      growth factor-beta), a central mediator in pulmonary fibrosis, and periostin in lung 
      fibroblasts leads to generation of pulmonary fibrosis and whether inhibitors for 
      integrin alpha(V)beta(3), a periostin receptor, can block pulmonary fibrosis in model 
      mice and the TGF-beta signals in fibroblasts from patients with IPF. We found that 
      cross-talk exists between TGF-beta and periostin signals via alpha(V)beta(3)/beta(5) 
      converging into Smad3. This cross-talk is necessary for the expression of TGF-beta 
      downstream effector molecules important for pulmonary fibrosis. Moreover, we 
      identified several potent integrin low-molecular-weight inhibitors capable of 
      blocking cross-talk with TGF-beta signaling. One of the compounds, CP4715, 
      attenuated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in vivo in mice and the TGF-beta 
      signals in vitro in fibroblasts from patients with IPF. These results suggest 
      that the cross-talk between TGF-beta and periostin can be targeted for pulmonary 
      fibrosis and that CP4715 can be a potential therapeutic agent to block this 
      cross-talk.

TI  - PTEN loss regulates alveolar epithelial cell senescence in pulmonary fibrosis 
      depending on Akt activation.
PG  - 7492-7509
LID - 10.18632/aging.102262 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an aging-associated disease with poor 
      prognosis. The mechanisms underlying the role of alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) 
      senescence in IPF remain poorly understood. We aimed to investigate if PTEN/Akt 
      activates AEC senescence to induce pulmonary fibrosis. We investigated the 
      association between PTEN/Akt and cellular senescence in lung tissues from IPF 
      patients. As a result, decreased PTEN and activated Akt pathway were found in 
      AECs in fibrotic lung tissues detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and 
      immunofluorescence (IF). Increased expression levels of aging-associated markers 
      (P21(WAF1) and SA-beta-gal) in AECs treated with bleomycin were found. AEC 
      senescence was accelerated by PTEN knockdown and attenuated by PTEN 
      overexpression. Bleomycin induced AEC senescence was reversed by Akt2 knockdown 
      and the pharmacological inhibitors (LY294002 and MK2206) of the Akt pathway. 
      Reducing Akt activation dramatically improved lung fibrosis in a fibrotic mice 
      model. In addition, a co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay demonstrated that PTEN 
      physically associated with Akt. These indicated that senescent AECs modulated by 
      the PTEN/Akt pathway promote lung fibrosis. In conclusion, our study demonstrated 
      that as a trigger indicator in IPF, the senescence process in AECs should be a 
      potential therapeutic target and that the PTEN/Akt pathway may be a promising 
      candidate for intervention.

TI  - Antifibrotic therapy for fibrotic lung disease beyond idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis.
LID - 10.1183/16000617.0022-2019 [doi]
LID - 190022
AB  - Two antifibrotic medications (nintedanib and pirfenidone) were recommended 
      (conditionally) for the treatment of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
      (IPF) in the 2015 IPF evidence-based guidelines. These medications have been 
      shown to reduce the rate of decline in forced vital capacity among patients with 
      IPF over time and are the only two disease-modulating pharmacological agents 
      approved by regulatory agencies and available for clinical use worldwide. With 
      the evolved standard of care for interstitial lung disease evaluation including 
      routine use of high-resolution computed tomography, fibrotic lung diseases other 
      than IPF are increasingly recognised. In addition, it is becoming evident that 
      genetic and pathophysiological mechanisms as well as disease behaviour in 
      patients manifesting other "non-IPF progressive fibrotic interstitial lung 
      diseases" (non-IPF-PF) may be similar to those in patients with IPF. Thus, it is 
      biologically plausible that pharmacological agents with antifibrotic properties 
      may be efficacious in non-IPF-PF. Indeed, studies are underway or planned to 
      assess the safety and efficacy of nintedanib or pirfenidone among patients with 
      several non-IPF fibrotic lung diseases. In this review, we briefly summarise the 
      use of pirfenidone and nintedanib in IPF as well as the rationale and potential 
      for use of these medications in non-IPF-PF that are being investigated in ongoing 
      and upcoming clinical trials.

LID - e131597
AB  - To develop a systems biology model of fibrosis progression within the human lung 
      we performed RNA sequencing and microRNA analysis on 95 samples obtained from 10 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and 6 control lungs. Extent of fibrosis in 
      each sample was assessed by microCT-measured alveolar surface density (ASD) and 
      confirmed by histology. Regulatory gene expression networks were identified using 
      linear mixed-effect models and dynamic regulatory events miner (DREM). 
      Differential gene expression analysis identified a core set of genes increased or 
      decreased before fibrosis was histologically evident that continued to change 
      with advanced fibrosis. DREM generated a systems biology model 
      (www.sb.cs.cmu.edu/IPFReg) that identified progressively divergent gene 
      expression tracks with microRNAs and transcription factors that specifically 
      regulate mild or advanced fibrosis. We confirmed model predictions by 
      demonstrating that expression of POU2AF1, previously unassociated with lung 
      fibrosis but proposed by the model as regulator, is increased in B lymphocytes in 
      IPF lungs and that POU2AF1-knockout mice were protected from bleomycin-induced 
      lung fibrosis. Our results reveal distinct regulation of gene expression changes 
      in IPF tissue that remained structurally normal compared with moderate or 
      advanced fibrosis and suggest distinct regulatory mechanisms for each stage.

TI  - A homozygous SFTPA1 mutation drives necroptosis of type II alveolar epithelial 
      cells in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 2724-2735
LID - 10.1084/jem.20182351 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal disease characterized by scattered 
      fibrotic lesions in the lungs. The pathogenesis and genetic basis of IPF remain 
      poorly understood. Here, we show that a homozygous missense mutation in SFTPA1 
      caused IPF in a consanguineous Japanese family. The mutation in SFTPA1 disturbed 
      the secretion of SFTPA1 protein. Sftpa1 knock-in (Sftpa1-KI) mice that harbored 
      the same mutation as patients spontaneously developed pulmonary fibrosis that was 
      accelerated by influenza virus infection. Sftpa1-KI mice showed increased 
      necroptosis of alveolar epithelial type II (AEII) cells with phosphorylation of 
      IRE1alpha leading to JNK-mediated up-regulation of Ripk3. The inhibition of JNK 
      ameliorated pulmonary fibrosis in Sftpa1-KI mice, and overexpression of Ripk3 in 
      Sftpa1-KI mice treated with a JNK inhibitor worsened pulmonary fibrosis. These 
      findings provide new insight into the mechanisms of IPF in which a mutation in 
      SFTPA1 promotes necroptosis of AEII cells through JNK-mediated up-regulation of 
      Ripk3, highlighting the necroptosis pathway as a therapeutic target for IPF.

AB  - Accumulation of senescent cells is associated with the progression of pulmonary 
      fibrosis, but mechanisms accounting for this linkage are not well understood. To 
      explore this issue, we investigated whether a class of biologically active 
      profibrotic lipids, the leukotrienes (LT), is part of the senescence-associated 
      secretory phenotype. The analysis of conditioned medium (CM), lipid extracts, and 
      gene expression of LT biosynthesis enzymes revealed that senescent cells secreted 
      LT, regardless of the origin of the cells or the modality of senescence 
      induction. The synthesis of LT was biphasic and followed by antifibrotic 
      prostaglandin (PG) secretion. The LT-rich CM of senescent lung fibroblasts 
      (IMR-90) induced profibrotic signaling in naive fibroblasts, which were abrogated 
      by inhibitors of ALOX5, the principal enzyme in LT biosynthesis. The 
      bleomycin-induced expression of genes encoding LT and PG synthases, level of 
      cysteinyl LT in the bronchoalveolar lavage, and overall fibrosis were reduced 
      upon senescent cell removal either in a genetic mouse model or after senolytic 
      treatment. Quantification of ALOX5+ cells in lung explants obtained from 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients indicated that half of these cells 
      were also senescent (p16Ink4a+). Unlike human fibroblasts from unused donor lungs 
      made senescent by irradiation, senescent IPF fibroblasts secreted LTs but failed 
      to synthesize PGs. This study demonstrates for the first time to our knowledge 
      that senescent cells secrete functional LTs, significantly contributing to the LT 
      pool known to cause or exacerbate IPF.

      Meta-Analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive, 
      fibrotic lung disease with a poor prognosis. Although many factors have been 
      identified that possibly trigger or aggravate IPF, such as viral infection, the 
      exact cause of IPF remains unclear. Until now, there has been no systematic 
      review to assess the role of viral infection in IPF quantitatively. OBJECTIVE: 
      This meta-analysis aims to present a collective view on the relationship between 
      viral infection and IPF. METHODS: We searched studies reporting the effect of 
      viral infection on IPF in the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, 
      and Wiley Online Library databases. We calculated ORs with 95% CIs to assess the 
      risk of virus in IPF. We also estimated statistical heterogeneity by using I(2) 
      and Cochran Q tests and publication bias by using the funnel plot, Begg test, 
      Egger test, and trim-and-fill methods. Regression, sensitivity, and subgroup 
      analyses were performed to assess the effects of confounding factors, such as sex 
      and age. RESULTS: We analyzed 20 case-control studies from 10 countries with 
      1,287 participants. The pooled OR of all viruses indicated that viral infection 
      could increase the risk of IPF significantly (OR, 3.48; 95% CI, 1.61-7.52; P = 
      .001), but not that of exacerbation of IPF (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.47-2.12; P = 
      .988). All analyzed viruses, including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus 
      (CMV), human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7), and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), were 
      associated with a significant elevation in the risk of IPF, except human 
      herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of persistent or chronic, but 
      not acute, viral infections, including EBV, CMV, HHV-7, and HHV-8, significantly 
      increases the risk of developing IPF, but not exacerbation of IPF. These findings 
      imply that viral infection could be a potential risk factor for IPF.

TI  - Grp78 Loss in Epithelial Progenitors Reveals an Age-linked Role for Endoplasmic 
      Reticulum Stress in Pulmonary Fibrosis.
PG  - 198-211
LID - 10.1164/rccm.201902-0451OC [doi]
AB  - Rationale: Alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) injury and dysregulated repair are 
      implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 
      stress in AEC has been observed in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a disease 
      of aging.Objectives: To investigate a causal role for ER stress in the 
      pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis (PF) and therapeutic potential of ER stress 
      inhibition in PF.Methods: The role of ER stress in AEC dysfunction and fibrosis 
      was studied in mice with tamoxifen (Tmx)-inducible deletion of ER chaperone 
      Grp78, a key regulator of ER homeostasis, in alveolar type II (AT2) cells, 
      progenitors of distal lung epithelium, and in IPF lung slice 
      cultures.Measurements and Main Results:Grp78 deletion caused weight loss, 
      mortality, lung inflammation, and spatially heterogeneous fibrosis characterized 
      by fibroblastic foci, hyperplastic AT2 cells, and increased susceptibility of old 
      and male mice, all features of IPF. Fibrosis was more persistent in more severely 
      injured Grp78 knockout (KO) mice. Grp78 KO AT2 cells showed evidence of ER 
      stress, apoptosis, senescence, impaired progenitor capacity, and activation of 
      TGF-beta (transforming growth factor-beta)/SMAD signaling. Glucose-regulated protein 78 
      is reduced in AT2 cells from old mice and patients with IPF, and ER stress 
      inhibitor tauroursodeoxycholic acid ameliorates ER stress and fibrosis in Grp78 
      KO mouse and IPF lung slice cultures.Conclusions: These results support a causal 
      role for ER stress and resulting epithelial dysfunction in PF and suggest ER 
      stress as a potential mechanism linking aging to IPF. Modulation of ER stress and 
      chaperone function may offer a promising therapeutic approach for pulmonary 
      fibrosis.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a relentlessly progressive and devastating 
      interstitial lung disease of unknown etiology, where the normal lung architecture 
      is lost and replaced by fibrotic tissue leading to an irreversible and 
      progressive respiratory insufficiency. Historically, IPF was considered a chronic 
      inflammatory disorder, which gradually progressed to established fibrosis. 
      However, strong clinical and experimental evidence indicates that the disease 
      represents an epithelial-driven disorder which results from a complex interplay 
      of genetic and environmental risk factors, aging-associated processes and a 
      profibrotic epigenetic reprogramming. The convergence of these factors results in 
      the aberrant activation of epithelial cells that initiate the development of the 
      disease, producing virtually all the mediators that participate in the migration, 
      proliferation and activation of fibroblasts, their differentiation to 
      myofibroblasts and the excessive and chaotic secretion of extracellular matrix 
      proteins. Although progress has been made in understanding the causes and 
      consequences of this abnormal behavior of distal airways and alveolar epithelium, 
      the mechanisms that initiate and perpetuate the vicious circle of 
      multidirectional abnormal communications between the epithelium and fibroblasts 
      and other resident cells have not been elucidated. In this review, we discuss the 
      role of epithelial cells and the mechanisms underlying the fibrotic response in 
      IPF, and highlight some promising therapeutic targets for these cells.

AB  - Type 2 insulin-like growth factor (IGF-II) levels are increased in fibrosing lung 
      diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and scleroderma/systemic 
      sclerosis-associated pulmonary fibrosis (SSc). Our goal was to investigate the 
      contribution of IGF receptors to IGF-II-mediated fibrosis in these diseases and 
      identify other potential mechanisms key to the fibrotic process. Cognate receptor 
      gene and protein expression were analyzed with qRT-PCR and immunoblot in primary 
      fibroblasts derived from lung tissues of normal donors (NL) and patients with IPF 
      or SSc. Compared to NL, steady-state receptor gene expression was decreased in 
      SSc but not in IPF. IGF-II stimulation differentially decreased receptor mRNA and 
      protein levels in NL, IPF, and SSc fibroblasts. Neutralizing antibody, siRNA, and 
      receptor inhibition targeting endogenous IGF-II and its primary receptors, type 1 
      IGF receptor (IGF1R), IGF2R, and insulin receptor (IR) resulted in loss of the 
      IGF-II response. IGF-II tipped the TIMP:MMP balance, promoting a fibrotic 
      environment both intracellularly and extracellularly. Differentiation of 
      fibroblasts into myofibroblasts by IGF-II was blocked with a TGFbeta1 receptor 
      inhibitor. IGF-II also increased TGFbeta2 and TGFbeta3 expression, with subsequent 
      activation of canonical SMAD2/3 signaling. Therefore, IGF-II promoted fibrosis 
      through IGF1R, IR, and IGF1R/IR, differentiated fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, 
      decreased protease production and extracellular matrix degradation, and 
      stimulated expression of two TGFbeta isoforms, suggesting that IGF-II exerts 
      pro-fibrotic effects via multiple mechanisms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although aberrant proliferation and activation of lung fibroblasts 
      are implicated in the initiation and progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
      (IPF), the underlying mechanisms are not well characterized. Numerous microRNAs 
      (miRNAs) have been implicated in this process; however, miRNAs derived from 
      exosomes and the relevance of such miRNAs to fibroblast-to-myofibroblast 
      differentiation are not well understood. In this study, we attempted to identify 
      exosome-derived miRNAs relevant to fibrosis development. METHODS: Using miRNA 
      array analysis, we profiled exosome-derived miRNA expression in sera of C57BL/6 
      mice exhibiting bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. After validating a selected 
      miRNA by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, its effect 
      on fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation was investigated in human lung 
      fibroblasts. Furthermore, we determined the role of the selected miRNA in an in 
      vivo model of pulmonary fibrosis. RESULTS: MiRNA array analysis revealed that 
      miR-22 expression was increased by up to 2 fold on day 7 after bleomycin 
      treatment compared with that in vehicle-treated mice. In vitro, miR-22 
      transfection suppressed TGF-beta1-induced alpha-SMA expression. This was mediated via 
      inhibition of the ERK1/2 pathway. Baseline alpha-SMA expression was increased upon 
      miR-22 inhibitor transfection. Furthermore, miR-22 negatively regulated 
      connective tissue growth factor expression in the presence of TGF-beta1. In vivo, 
      administration of a miR-22 mimic on day 10 after bleomycin challenge ameliorated 
      pulmonary fibrosis lesions accompanied by decreased alpha-SMA expression in the model 
      mice. CONCLUSIONS: Exosomal miR-22 modulates fibroblast-to-myofibroblast 
      differentiation. The present findings warrant further study, which could shed 
      light on miR-22 as a novel therapeutic target in IPF.

TI  - GLUT1-dependent glycolysis regulates exacerbation of fibrosis via AIM2 
      inflammasome activation.
PG  - 227-236
LID - 10.1136/thoraxjnl-2019-213571 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rapidly progressive, fatal 
      lung disease that affects older adults. One of the detrimental natural histories 
      of IPF is acute exacerbation of IPF (AE-IPF), of which bacterial infection is 
      reported to play an important role. However, the mechanism by which bacterial 
      infection modulates the fibrotic response remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: Altered 
      glucose metabolism has been implicated in the pathogenesis of fibrotic lung 
      diseases. We have previously demonstrated that glucose transporter 1 
      (GLUT1)-dependent glycolysis regulates fibrogenesis in a murine fibrosis model. 
      To expand on these findings, we hypothesised that GLUT1-dependent glycolysis 
      regulates acute exacerbation of lung fibrogenesis during bacterial infection via 
      AIM2 inflammasome activation. RESULTS: In our current study, using a murine model 
      of Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) infection, we investigated the 
      potential role of GLUT1 on mediating fibrotic responses to an acute exacerbation 
      during bleomycin-induced fibrosis. The results of our current study illustrate 
      that GLUT1 deficiency ameliorates S. pneumoniae-mediated exacerbation of lung 
      fibrosis (wild type (WT)/phosphate buffered saline (PBS), n=3; WT/S. pneumoniae, 
      n=3; WT/Bleomycin, n=5 ; WT/Bleomycin+S. pneumoniae, n=7; LysM-Cre-Glut1(fl/f) 
      /PBS, n=3; LysM-Cre-Glut1(fl/fl) /S. pneumoniae, n=3; LysM-Cre-Glut1(fl/fl) 
      /Bleomycin, n=6; LysM-Cre-Glut1(fl/fl) /Bleomycin+S. pneumoniae, n=9, p=0.041). 
      Further, the AIM2 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex essential for sensing 
      cytosolic bacterial DNA as a danger signal, is an important regulator of this 
      GLUT1-mediated fibrosis and genetic deficiency of AIM2 reduced bleomycin-induced 
      fibrosis after S. pneumoniae infection (WT/PBS, n=6; WT/Bleomycin+S. pneumoniae, 
      n=15; Aim2(-/-)/PBS, n=6, Aim2(-/-)/Bleomycin+S. pneumoniae, n=11, p=0.034). 
      GLUT1 deficiency reduced expression and function of the AIM2 inflammasome, and 
      AIM2-deficient mice showed substantial reduction of lung fibrosis after S. 
      pneumoniae infection. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that GLUT1-dependent 
      glycolysis promotes exacerbation of lung fibrogenesis during S. pneumoniae 
      infection via AIM2 inflammasome activation.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a serious lung disease that involved the 
      myofibroblast differentiation of lung resident mesenchymal stem cells (LR-MSCs). 
      However, the specific molecular mechanisms of myofibroblast differentiation of 
      LR-MSCs still remain a mystery. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of miRNAs 
      and mRNAs changes in LR-MSCs treated with TGF-beta1 was performed. Through 
      computational approaches, the pivotal roles of differentially expressed miRNAs 
      that were associated with tight junction, pathways in cancer, focal adhesion, and 
      cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction were shown. Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) 
      and inhibitor of growth family, member 5 (Ing5) may be the targets for the 
      therapy of pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting myofibroblast differentiation of 
      LR-MSCs and EMT. Collectively, a molecular paradigm for understanding 
      myofibroblast differentiation of LR-MSCs in IPF was provided by the integrated 
      miRNA/mRNA analyses.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating and fatal disease and 
      characterized by increased deposition of extracellular matrix proteins and scar 
      formation in the lung, resulting from alveolar epithelial damage and accumulation 
      of inflammatory cells. Evidence suggests that Caveolin-1 (Cav-1), a major 
      component of caveolae which regulates cell signaling and endocytosis, is a 
      potential target to treat fibrotic diseases, although the mechanisms and 
      responsible cell types are unclear. We show that Cav-1 expression was 
      downregulated both in alveolar epithelial type I cells in bleomycin-injured mouse 
      lungs and in lung sections from IPF patients. Increased expression of IL-1beta and 
      caspase-1 has been observed in IPF patients, indicating inflammasome activation 
      associated with IPF. Gene transfer of a plasmid expressing Cav-1 using 
      transthoracic electroporation reduced infiltration of neutrophils and 
      monocytes/macrophages and protected from subsequent bleomycin-induced pulmonary 
      fibrosis. Overexpression of Cav-1 suppressed bleomycin- or silica-induced 
      activation of caspase-1 and maturation of pro-IL-1beta to secrete cleaved IL-1beta both 
      in mouse lungs and in primary type I cells. These results demonstrate that gene 
      transfer of Cav-1 downregulates inflammasome activity and protects from 
      subsequent bleomycin-mediated pulmonary fibrosis. This indicates a pivotal 
      regulation of Cav-1 in inflammasome activity and suggests a novel therapeutic 
      strategy for patients with IPF.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal chronic lung disease characterized 
      by progressive scarring of the lung tissue, leading to respiratory failure. There 
      is no cure for IPF, and current anti-fibrotic treatments modestly arrest its 
      further progression. IPF prevalence and incidence increase with age, which is a 
      recognized risk factor. Intense clinical and basic research over the last fifteen 
      years has shown that hallmarks of accelerated aging are present in the lungs of 
      patients with IPF. Different cell types in IPF lungs exhibit premature hallmarks 
      of aging, including telomere attrition and cellular senescence. In this Review, 
      we discuss recent insights into the mechanisms behind these age-related 
      alterations and their contribution to the development of lung fibrosis. We focus 
      on the genetic and molecular basis of telomere attrition in alveolar type II 
      epithelial cells, which promote cellular senescence and lung fibrosis. 
      Mechanistically, senescent cells secrete pro-fibrotic factors that activate 
      scar-forming myofibroblasts. Ultimately, senescent alveolar epithelial cells lose 
      their regenerative capacity, impeding fibrosis resolution. In addition, 
      mitochondrial dysfunction is strongly associated with the appearance of senescent 
      epithelial cells and senescent myofibroblasts in IPF, which persist in the 
      fibrotic tissue by adapting their metabolic pathways and becoming resistant to 
      apoptosis. We discuss emerging novel therapeutic strategies to treat IPF by 
      targeting cellular senescence with the so-called senotherapeutics.

TI  - The circadian clock protein REVERBalpha inhibits pulmonary fibrosis development.
PG  - 1139-1147
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1912109117 [doi]
AB  - Pulmonary inflammatory responses lie under circadian control; however, the 
      importance of circadian mechanisms in the underlying fibrotic phenotype is not 
      understood. Here, we identify a striking change to these mechanisms resulting in 
      a gain of amplitude and lack of synchrony within pulmonary fibrotic tissue. These 
      changes result from an infiltration of mesenchymal cells, an important cell type 
      in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. Mutation of the core clock protein 
      REVERBalpha in these cells exacerbated the development of bleomycin-induced fibrosis, 
      whereas mutation of REVERBalpha in club or myeloid cells had no effect on the 
      bleomycin phenotype. Knockdown of REVERBalpha revealed regulation of the 
      little-understood transcription factor TBPL1. Both REVERBalpha and TBPL1 altered 
      integrinbeta1 focal-adhesion formation, resulting in increased myofibroblast 
      activation. The translational importance of our findings was established through 
      analysis of 2 human cohorts. In the UK Biobank, circadian strain markers (sleep 
      length, chronotype, and shift work) are associated with pulmonary fibrosis, 
      making them risk factors. In a separate cohort, REVERBalpha expression was increased 
      in human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) lung tissue. Pharmacological 
      targeting of REVERBalpha inhibited myofibroblast activation in IPF fibroblasts and 
      collagen secretion in organotypic cultures from IPF patients, thus suggesting 
      that targeting of REVERBalpha could be a viable therapeutic approach.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Family with sequence similarity 13 member A (FAM13A) genetic variants 
      have been associated with several chronic respiratory diseases including chronic 
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis (CF), idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF) and lung cancer. The FAM13A protein includes a RhoGTPase 
      activating protein (RhoGAP) domain known to participate in various cellular 
      mechanisms including cell proliferation. While intensive genomic studies have 
      been performed to reveal its involvement in lung diseases, the biological role of 
      FAM13A protein is still not completely elucidated. RESULTS: We therefore 
      performed a two-hybrid screening to identify protein partners of FAM13A using a 
      human lung cancer cDNA library. We identified several protein partners with a 
      high confidence score. Researchers in the field of chronic lung diseases may 
      benefit from this two-hybrid screening data which may reveal new research 
      pathways to decipher.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive chronic disease 
      characterized by excessing scarring of the lungs leading to irreversible decline 
      in lung function. The aetiology and pathogenesis of the disease are still 
      unclear, although lung fibroblast and epithelial cell activation, as well as the 
      secretion of fibrotic and inflammatory mediators, have been strongly associated 
      with the development and progression of IPF. Significantly, long non-coding RNAs 
      (lncRNAs) are emerging as modulators of multiple biological processes, although 
      their function and mechanism of action in IPF is poorly understood. LncRNAs have 
      been shown to be important regulators of several diseases and their aberrant 
      expression has been linked to the pathophysiology of fibrosis including IPF. This 
      review will provide an overview of this emerging role of lncRNAs in the 
      development of IPF.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fatal lung disorder with an 
      unknown etiology and very limited therapeutic options. The incidence and severity 
      of IPF increase with advanced age, suggesting that aging is a major risk factor 
      for IPF. The mechanism underlying the aging-related susceptibility to IPF, 
      however, remains unclear. Cellular senescence, a permanent arrest of cell growth, 
      has been increasingly recognized as an important contributor to aging and 
      aging-related diseases, including IPF. Senescent cells have been identified in 
      IPF lungs and in experimental lung fibrosis models. Removal of senescent cells 
      pharmacologically or genetically improves lung function and reverses pulmonary 
      fibrosis induced by different stimuli in experimental fibrosis models. Treatment 
      with senolytic drugs also improves clinical symptoms in IPF patients. These 
      intriguing findings suggest that cellular senescence contributes importantly to 
      the pathogenesis of fibrotic lung diseases and targeting senescent cells may 
      represent a novel approach for the treatment of fibrotic lung disorders. In this 
      mini review, we summarize the recent advance in the field regarding the role of 
      cellular senescence in fibrotic lung diseases, with a focus on IPF.

      Aging.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal age-associated disease with no 
      cure. Although IPF is widely regarded as a disease of aging, the cellular 
      mechanisms that contribute to this age-associated predilection remain elusive. In 
      this study, we sought to evaluate the consequences of senescence on myofibroblast 
      cell fate and fibrotic responses to lung injury in the context of aging. We 
      demonstrated that nonsenescent lung myofibroblasts maintained the capacity for 
      dedifferentiation, whereas senescent/IPF myofibroblasts exhibited an impaired 
      capacity for dedifferentiation. We previously demonstrated that the transcription 
      factor MyoD acts as a critical switch in the differentiation and 
      dedifferentiation of myofibroblasts. Here, we demonstrate that decreased levels 
      of MyoD preceded myofibroblast dedifferentiation and apoptosis susceptibility in 
      nonsenescent cells, whereas MyoD expression remained elevated in senescent/IPF 
      myofibroblasts, which failed to undergo dedifferentiation and demonstrated 
      resistance to apoptosis. Genetic strategies to silence MyoD restored the 
      susceptibility of IPF myofibroblasts to undergo apoptosis and led to a partial 
      reversal of age-associated persistent fibrosis in vivo. The capacity for 
      myofibroblast dedifferentiation and subsequent apoptosis may be critical for 
      normal physiologic responses to tissue injury, whereas restricted 
      dedifferentiation and apoptosis resistance in senescent cells may underlie the 
      progressive nature of age-associated human fibrotic disorders. These studies 
      support the concept that senescence may promote profibrotic effects via impaired 
      myofibroblast dedifferentiation and apoptosis resistance, which contributes to 
      myofibroblast accumulation and ultimately persistent fibrosis in aging.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) plays a special role within the group of 
      interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) due to its inexorable progression and its 
      specific medical treatment. With a median survival of only 2-3 years from the 
      time of diagnosis, the prognosis is worse than many carcinomas.In contrast to 
      other ILDs, IPF does not respond to anti-inflammatory treatment with 
      corticosteroids but rather demands a specific medical therapy. Even though this 
      cannot cure the disease, it can prolong survival. Lung transplantation is the 
      only cure for progressive lung fibrosis. The clinical course is individual and 
      difficult to predict. Acute exacerbations accelerate the clinical course and lead 
      to high mortality.The underlying pathomechanisms of IPF, with its complex 
      immunological and inflammatory processes and external impacts, have been the 
      focus of recent research. Lifestyle and environmental influences are held 
      responsible for much of its natural history. Smoking, pneumotoxic medications, 
      and inhalation of dusts are well-known risk factors. Likewise, genetic and 
      hereditary factors play a crucial role.This short review focuses on the 
      peculiarities of IPF within the group of ILDs, especially in relation to its 
      underlying mechanisms and clinical progression.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fibrotic lung disease with poor 
      prognosis. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been reported to play an 
      important role in IPF. The extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 
      (ERK1/2) cascade, which regulates EMT and oncogenesis, has been implicated in the 
      pathogenesis of IPF. Calpains, Ca(2+)-dependent cysteine proteinases that mediate 
      controlled proteolysis of many specific substrates including epithelial cell 
      marker E-cadherin, participate in organ fibrosis. Calpain-1 and calpain-2 of 
      calpain family are ubiquitous calpains. ERK1/2 signaling stimulates the 
      ubiquitous calpains activity in cancer development, but whether ERK1/2 signaling 
      mediates the ubiquitous calpains activity in pulmonary fibrosis is unknown. Here 
      we investigated whether inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling and the ubiquitous 
      calpains attenuated experimental pulmonary fibrosis and examined the potential 
      mechanism. Our results showed that inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling and the 
      ubiquitous calpains both attenuated bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung fibrosis in 
      mice. Inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling downregulated the expression of calpain-1 
      and calpain-2 in vivo and in vitro. We detected decreased E-cadherin expression 
      and increased calpain-1 expression in IPF patients. Inhibition of ERK1/2 
      signaling and the ubiquitous calpains both suppressed the development of EMT in 
      vivo and in vitro. Our study indicated that inhibition of the ERK1/2-ubiquitous 
      calpains pathway protected pulmonary fibrosis from BLM, possibly via inhibition 
      of EMT. Therefore, targeting ubiquitous calpains may be a potential strategy to 
      attenuate IPF.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease with poor prognosis 
      due to limited clinical treatment options. IPF is characterized by the augmented 
      deposition of extracellular matrix driven by myofibroblasts, and the 
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been known to play an essential role 
      in the mechanism of pulmonary fibrosis. Previous genome-wide association study 
      identified Fam13a as one of genes that showed genetic link with IPF and chronic 
      obstructive pulmonary disease. Here, we analyzed the role of Fam13a in the 
      pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis using Fam13a-deficient mice. We found that 
      Fam13a was down-regulated in mouse lungs of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis 
      model. Of note, genetic deletion of Fam13a exacerbated the lung fibrosis induced 
      by bleomycin in association with enhanced EMT in mice. Moreover, silencing of 
      Fam13a accelerated EMT induced by TGF-beta and TNF-alpha in alveolar epithelial cells, 
      accompanied by increased active beta-catenin and its nuclear accumulation. Our data 
      revealed a crucial role of Fam13a in the development of pulmonary fibrosis 
      potentially through inhibiting EMT, and thus Fam13a has a therapeutic potential 
      in the treatment of IPF.

TI  - Matrix Metalloproteinases Retain Soluble FasL-mediated Resistance to Cell Death 
      in Fibrotic-Lung Myofibroblasts.
LID - 10.3390/cells9020411 [doi]
LID - 411
AB  - A prominent feature of obstructed tissue regeneration following injury in 
      general, and fibrotic lung tissue in particular, is fibroblast proliferation and 
      accumulation. The Fas/FasL apoptotic pathway has been shown to be involved in 
      human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in 
      rodents. We previously showed that in normal injury repair, myofibroblasts' 
      accumulation is followed by their decline by FasL(+) T cell-induced cell death. 
      In pathological lung fibrosis, myofibroblasts resist cell death and accumulate. 
      Like other members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family, membrane-bound FasL 
      can be cleaved from the cell surface to generate a soluble form (sFasL). 
      Metalloproteinases (MMPs) are known to convert the membrane-bound form of FasL to 
      sFasL. MMP-7 knockout (KO) mice were shown to be protected from bleomycin 
      (BLM)-induced lung fibrosis. In this study, we detected increased levels of sFasL 
      in their blood serum, as in the lungs of patients with IPF, and IPF-lung 
      myofibroblast culture medium. In this study, using an MMP-inhibitor, we showed 
      that sFasL is decreased in cultures of IPF-lung myofibroblasts and BLM-treated 
      lung myofibroblasts, and in the blood serum of MMP-7KO mice. Moreover, resistant 
      fibrotic-lung myofibroblasts, from the lungs of humans with IPF and of 
      BLM-treated mice, became susceptible to T-cell induced cell death in a co-culture 
      following MMP-inhibition- vs. control-treatment or BLM-treated MMP-7KO vs. 
      wild-type mice, respectively. sFasL may be an unrecognized mechanism for 
      MMP-7-mediated decreased tissue regeneration following injury and the evolution 
      of lung fibrosis.

TI  - IPF pathogenesis is dependent upon TGFbeta induction of IGF-1.
PG  - 5363-5388
LID - 10.1096/fj.201901719RR [doi]
AB  - Pathogenic fibrotic diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), have 
      some of the worst prognoses and affect millions of people worldwide. With unclear 
      etiology and minimally effective therapies, two-thirds of IPF patients die within 
      2-5 years from this progressive interstitial lung disease. Transforming Growth 
      Factor Beta (TGFbeta) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) are known to promote 
      fibrosis; however, myofibroblast specific upregulation of IGF-1 in the initiation 
      and progression of TGFbeta-induced fibrogenesis and IPF have remained unexplored. To 
      address this, the current study (1) documents the upregulation of IGF-1 via TGFbeta 
      in myofibroblasts and fibrotic lung tissue, as well as its correlation with 
      decreased pulmonary function in advanced IPF; (2) identifies IGF-1's C1 promoter 
      as mediating the increase in IGF-1 transcription by TGFbeta in pulmonary 
      fibroblasts; (3) determines that SMAD2 and mTOR signaling are required for 
      TGFbeta-dependent Igf-1 expression in myofibroblasts; (4) demonstrates IGF-1R 
      activation is essential to support TGFbeta-driven profibrotic myofibroblast 
      functions and excessive wound healing; and (5) establishes the effectiveness of 
      slowing the progression of murine lung fibrosis with the IGF-1R inhibitor 
      OSI-906. These findings expand our knowledge of IGF-1's role as a novel 
      fibrotic-switch, bringing us one step closer to understanding the complex 
      biological mechanisms responsible for fibrotic diseases and developing effective 
      therapies.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a group of chronic interstitial pulmonary 
      diseases characterized by myofibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix 
      deposition with limited treatment options. Based on our previous observation, we 
      hypothesized microcystin-leucine arginine (LR), an environmental cyanobacterial 
      toxin, could potentially suppress pulmonary fibrosis. In this study, we first 
      demonstrated that chronic exposure of microcystin-LR by oral for weeks indeed 
      attenuated the pulmonary fibrosis both on bleomycin-induced rat and fluorescein 
      isothiocyanate-induced mouse models. Our data further indicated that treatment 
      with microcystin-LR substantially reduced TGF-beta1/Smad signaling in rat pulmonary 
      tissues. The experiments in vitro found that microcystin-LR was capable of 
      blocking epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and fibroblast-myofibroblast 
      transition (FMT) through suppressing the differentiation of CD206(+) macrophages. 
      Mechanically, microcystin-LR was found to bind to glucose-regulated protein 
      78 kDa (GRP78) and suppress endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response 
      (UPR(ER)) signaling pathways. These events led to the modulation of M2 
      polarization of macrophages, which eventually contributed to the alleviation of 
      pulmonary fibrosis. Our results revealed a novel mechanism that may account for 
      therapeutic effect of microcystin-LR on IPF.

TI  - MeCP2 epigenetically regulates alpha-smooth muscle actin in human lung 
      fibroblasts.
PG  - 3616-3625
LID - 10.1002/jcb.29655 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A critical feature for fibroblasts differentiation into 
      myofibroblasts is the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) during the 
      tissue injury and repair process. The epigenetic mechanism, DNA methylation, is 
      involved in regulating alpha-SMA expression. It is not clear how methyl-CpG-binding 
      protein 2 (MeCP2) interacts with CpG-rich region in alpha-SMA, and if the CpG 
      methylation status would affect MeCP2 binding and regulation of alpha-SMA expression. 
      METHODS: The association of MeCP2 with alpha-SMA CpG rich region were examined by 
      chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays in primary fibroblasts from 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and non-IPF control individuals, and in the 
      lung fibroblasts treated with profibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor beta1 
      (TGF-beta1). The regulation of alpha-SMA by MeCP2 was examined by knocking down MeCP2 
      with small interfering RNA (siRNA). To explore the effects of the DNA methylation 
      status of the CpG rich region on alpha-SMA expression, the cells were treated with 
      DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5'-azacytidine (5'-aza). The expression of alpha-SMA 
      was examined by Western blot and quantitative polymerase chain reaction, the 
      association with MeCP2 was assessed by ChIP assays, and the methylation status 
      was checked by bisulfate sequencing. RESULTS: The human lung fibroblasts with 
      increased alpha-SMA showed an enriched association of MeCP2, while knockdown MeCP2 by 
      siRNA reduced alpha-SMA upregulation by TGF-beta1. The 5'-Aza-treated cells have 
      decreased alpha-SMA expression with reduced MeCP2 association. However, bisulfite 
      sequencing revealed that most CpG sites are unmethylated despite the different 
      expression levels of alpha-SMA after being treated by TGF-beta1 or 5'-aza. CONCLUSION: 
      Our data indicate that the methyl-binding protein MeCP2 is critical for alpha-SMA 
      expression in human lung myofibroblast, and the DNA methylation status at the CpG 
      rich region of alpha-SMA is not a determinative factor for its inducible expression.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal disease without 
      therapeutic options. The development of new therapeutic strategies for the 
      disease is needed. IPF is characterized by myofibroblast accumulation and 
      collagen overproduction. Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) is a key cytokine 
      activating these pathological processes. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are crucial 
      regulators and promote TGF-beta1 activity. Among them, HSP27 is overexpressed in 
      animal models and in the lung of patients with IPF. HSP27 activates pro-fibrotic 
      mechanisms and therefore may represents a potential target. Strategies aiming to 
      inhibit HSP27 might pave the way towards new treatment options for patients with 
      IPF.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an agnogenic, rare, and lethal disease, 
      with high mortality and poor prognosis and a median survival time as short as 3 
      to 5 years after diagnosis. No effective therapeutic drugs are still 
      not available not only in clinical practice, but also in preclinical phases. To 
      better and deeper understand pulmonary fibrosis will provide more effective 
      strategies for therapy. Mounting evidence suggests that noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) 
      and their interactions may contribute to lung fibrosis; however, the mechanisms 
      underlying their roles are largely unknown. In this review, we systematically 
      summarized the recent advances regarding the crucial roles of long non-coding 
      RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs) and crosstalk 
      among them in the development of IPF. The perspective for related genes was well 
      highlighted. In summary, ncRNA and their interactions play a key regulatory part 
      in the progression of IPF and are bound to provide us with new diagnostic and 
      therapeutic targets.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fibroblast dysfunction is the main pathogenic mechanism underpinning 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily J 
      member 2 (KCNJ2) plays critical roles in the proliferation of myofibroblasts and 
      in the development of cardiac fibrosis. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate 
      the role of KCNJ2 in IPF. METHODS: KCNJ2 mRNA expression was measured using 
      real-time PCR in fibroblasts from IPF patients and normal controls (NCs). Protein 
      concentrations were measured by ELISA in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid 
      obtained from NCs (n = 30), IPF (n = 30), IPF (n = 30), IPF (n = 30), IPF 
      (n = 30), IPF (. RESULTS: KCNJ2 mRNA expression was measured using real-time PCR 
      in fibroblasts from IPF patients and normal controls (NCs). Protein 
      concentrations were measured by ELISA in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid 
      obtained from NCs (n = 30), IPF (n = 30), IPF (p < 0.001). KCNJ2 protein levels 
      in BAL fluid were significantly higher in IPF (6.587 [1.441-26.01] ng/mL) than in 
      NCs (0.084 [0.00-0.260] ng/mL, p < 0.001). KCNJ2 protein levels in BAL fluid were 
      significantly higher in IPF (6.587 [1.441-26.01] ng/mL) than in NCs (0.084 
      [0.00-0.260] ng/mL, p < 0.001). KCNJ2 protein levels in BAL fluid were 
      significantly higher in IPF (6.587 [1.441-26.01] ng/mL) than in NCs (0.084 
      [0.00-0.260] ng/mL, p < 0.001). KCNJ2 protein levels in BAL fluid were 
      significantly higher in IPF (6.587 [1.441-26.01] ng/mL) than in NCs (0.084 
      [0.00-0.260] ng/mL, p < 0.001). KCNJ2 protein levels in BAL fluid were 
      significantly higher in IPF (6.587 [1.441-26.01] ng/mL) than in NCs (0.084 
      [0.00-0.260] ng/mL. CONCLUSION: KCNJ2 may participate in the development of IPF, 
      and its protein level may be a candidate diagnostic and therapeutic molecule for 
      IPF.

TI  - Association between Telomere-Related Polymorphisms and the Risk of IPF and COPD 
      as a Precursor Lesion of Lung Cancer: Findings from the Fukuoka Tobacco-Related 
      Lung Disease (FOLD) Registry.
PG  - 667-673

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lung cancer coexisting with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) or 
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can lead to poor prognosis.  
      Telomere-related polymorphisms may be implicated in the pathogenesis of these 
      three lung diseases.  As to elucidate the mechanism of lung cancer via IPF or 
      COPD may enable early detection and early treatment of the disease, we firstly 
      examined the association between telomere-related polymorphisms and the risk of 
      IPF and COPD in a case-control study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 572 
      patients with IPF (n = 155) or COPD (n = 417), who were derived from our on-going 
      cohort study, and controls (n = 379), who were derived from our previous 
      case-control study, were included in this study.  Telomerase reverse 
      transcriptase (TERT) rs2736100, telomere RNA component (TERC) rs1881984, and 
      oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding fold containing1 (OBFC1) rs11191865 were 
      genotyped with real-time PCR using TaqMan fluorescent probes. Unconditional 
      logistic regression was used to assess the adjusted odds ratios and 95% 
      confidence intervals. RESULTS: TERT rs2736100 was significantly associated with 
      the risk of IPF; increases in the number of this risk allele increased the risk 
      of IPF (Ptrend = 0.008).  Similarly, TERT rs2736100 was associated with the risk 
      of COPD.  In regard to the combined action of the three loci, increasing numbers 
      of "at-risk" genotypes increased the risk of IPF in a dose-dependent manner (P 
      trend=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: TERT rs2736100 was associated with the risks of both 
      IPF and COPD in a Japanese population. A combination of the "at-risk" genotypes 
      might be important to identify the population at risk for IPF more clearly.

TI  - Alveolar Epithelial Type II Cells as Drivers of Lung Fibrosis in Idiopathic 
      Pulmonary Fibrosis.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21072269 [doi]
LID - 2269
AB  - : Alveolar epithelial type II cells (AT2) are a heterogeneous population that 
      have critical secretory and regenerative roles in the alveolus to maintain lung 
      homeostasis. However, impairment to their normal functional capacity and 
      development of a pro-fibrotic phenotype has been demonstrated to contribute to 
      the development of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). A number of factors 
      contribute to AT2 death and dysfunction. As a mucosal surface, AT2 cells are 
      exposed to environmental stresses that can have lasting effects that contribute 
      to fibrogenesis. Genetical risks have also been identified that can cause AT2 
      impairment and the development of lung fibrosis. Furthermore, aging is a final 
      factor that adds to the pathogenic changes in AT2 cells. Here, we will discuss 
      the homeostatic role of AT2 cells and the studies that have recently defined the 
      heterogeneity of this population of cells. Furthermore, we will review the 
      mechanisms of AT2 death and dysfunction in the context of lung fibrosis.

TI  - Endogenous itaconate is not required for particulate matter-induced NRF2 
      expression or inflammatory response.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.54877 [doi]
LID - e54877
AB  - Particulate matter (PM) air pollution causes cardiopulmonary mortality via 
      macrophage-driven lung inflammation; however, the mechanisms are incompletely 
      understood. RNA-sequencing demonstrated Acod1 (Aconitate decarboxylase 1) as one 
      of the top genes induced by PM in macrophages. Acod1 encodes a mitochondrial 
      enzyme that produces itaconate, which has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory 
      effects via NRF2 after LPS. Here, we demonstrate that PM induces Acod1 and 
      itaconate, which reduced mitochondrial respiration via complex II inhibition. 
      Using Acod1(-/-) mice, we found that Acod1/endogenous itaconate does not affect 
      PM-induced inflammation or NRF2 activation in macrophages in vitro or in vivo. In 
      contrast, exogenous cell permeable itaconate, 4-octyl itaconate (OI) attenuated 
      PM-induced inflammation in macrophages. OI was sufficient to activate NRF2 in 
      macrophages; however, NRF2 was not required for the anti-inflammatory effects of 
      OI. We conclude that the effects of itaconate production on inflammation are 
      stimulus-dependent, and that there are important differences between endogenous 
      and exogenously-applied itaconate.

OAB - Air pollution is a major global health problem that causes around 4.2 million 
      deaths each year. Once inhaled, pollution particles can remain in the lungs, 
      where they cause inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately chronic disease. 
      Macrophages, a population of immune cells in the lungs, are involved in this 
      inflammatory process. Itaconate is a molecule with potential anti-inflammatory 
      effects, produced by mammalian cells including macrophages. Recent studies have 
      shown that a modified form of the molecule, 4-octyl itaconate, reduces 
      inflammation when applied to cells exposed to lipopolysaccharide, a component of 
      infectious bacteria that is, usually, a strong trigger of inflammation. These 
      experiments used the 4-octyl modification to ensure that itaconate could get into 
      the cells. Itaconate's anti-inflammatory action is thought to work by activating 
      a signaling process in cells called the NRF2 pathway. NRF2 is a protein made by 
      'active' macrophages, that is, macrophages already primed to respond to foreign 
      particles. NRF2 in turn increases production of factors that 'damp down' 
      inflammation, all of which are collectively termed the NRF2 anti-inflammatory 
      pathway. Although macrophages in the lungs are linked with inflammation caused by 
      air pollution, their role - and that of itaconate - is still not well-understood. 
      Sun et al. therefore wanted to determine if itaconate helps macrophages control 
      pollution-induced inflammation. Initial experiments treated mouse macrophage 
      cells with pollution particles. Analyzing gene activity in these cells showed 
      that exposure to pollution did indeed switch on the Acod1 gene, which encodes the 
      enzyme that makes itaconate. It also turned on genes for other molecules involved 
      in inflammation. Pre-treating macrophages with 4-octyl itaconate before pollution 
      exposure reduced inflammation and also, as expected, turned on the NRF2 pathway. 
      To determine whether cells' own production of itaconate affected lung 
      inflammation, macrophages were isolated from mutant mice lacking Acod1. Comparing 
      these cells, which could not make itaconate, with normal cells revealed that 
      removing itaconate did not change the inflammatory response to pollution. 
      Activity of the NRF2 pathway also remained similar in both types of cells. This 
      showed that itaconate produced by macrophages likely has different effects on 
      lung inflammation from other forms of the compound. These findings represent a 
      step forward in understanding how pollution interacts with immune cells in the 
      lungs. They reveal that the source of anti-inflammatory factors can be just as 
      important in shaping immune responses as the type of factor. These results 
      highlight the need for further, detailed work on the mechanisms underlying 
      pollution-induced disease.

AB  - Biomarkers have the potential to become central to the clinical evaluation and 
      monitoring of patients with chronic fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) 
      with a progressive phenotype. Here we summarize the current understanding of 
      putative serum, BAL fluid, and genetic biomarkers in this setting, according to 
      their hypothesized pathobiologic mechanisms: evidence of epithelial cell 
      dysfunction (eg, Krebs von den Lungen-6 antigen), fibroblast proliferation and 
      extracellular matrix production or turnover (eg, matrix metalloproteinase-1), or 
      immune dysregulation (eg, CC chemokine ligand 18). While most of the available 
      data come from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), the prototypic progressive 
      fibrosing ILD, data are available in the broader patient population of chronic 
      fibrosing ILDs. A number of these biomarkers show promise, however, none have 
      been validated. In this review article, we assess both the status of proposed 
      biomarkers for chronic fibrosing lung diseases with a progressive phenotype in 
      predicting disease risk or predisposition, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment 
      response and provide a direct comparison between IPF and other chronic fibrotic 
      ILDs. We also reflect on the current clinical usefulness and future direction of 
      research for biomarkers in the setting of chronic fibrosing ILDs with a 
      progressive phenotype.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic disease with high mortality and 
      is refractory to treatment. Pulmonary macrophages can both promote and repress 
      fibrosis, however molecular mechanisms regulating macrophage functions during 
      fibrosis remain poorly understood. FOXM1 is a transcription factor and is not 
      expressed in quiescent lungs. Herein, we show that FOXM1 is highly expressed in 
      pulmonary macrophages within fibrotic lungs of IPF patients and mouse fibrotic 
      lungs. Macrophage-specific deletion of Foxm1 in mice (myFoxm1-/-) exacerbated 
      pulmonary fibrosis. Inactivation of FOXM1 in vivo and in vitro increased p38 MAPK 
      signaling in macrophages and decreased DUSP1, a negative regulator of p38 MAPK 
      pathway. FOXM1 directly activated Dusp1 promoter. Overexpression of DUSP1 in 
      FOXM1-deficient macrophages prevented activation of p38 MAPK pathway. Adoptive 
      transfer of wild-type monocytes to myFoxm1-/- mice alleviated bleomycin-induced 
      fibrosis. Altogether, contrary to known pro-fibrotic activities in lung 
      epithelium and fibroblasts, FOXM1 has anti-fibrotic function in macrophages by 
      regulating p38 MAPK.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), characterized by excessive collagen 
      deposition, is a progressive and typically fatal lung disease without effective 
      therapeutic strategies. Juglanin, as a natural product mainly isolated from green 
      walnut husks of Juglans mandshuric, has various bioactivities, including 
      anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects. Stimulator of 
      interferon genes (Sting) is a signaling molecule and plays an essential role in 
      meditating fibrosis. However, the effects of Jug and Sting on pulmonary fibrosis 
      are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the role of Jug in 
      bleomycin (BLM)-induced inflammation and fibrosis mouse model, as well as the 
      underlying molecular mechanism. The results here indicated that Jug-treated mice 
      exhibited a definitively improved survival rate than that of the BLM-challenged 
      mice. Jug administration significantly alleviated neutrophil alveolar 
      infiltration, lung vascular permeability and pro-inflammatory response in BLM 
      mice. Subsequently, the pulmonary fibrosis induced by BLM was markedly attenuated 
      by Jug through reducing the expression of fibrotic hallmarks, including 
      transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), fibronectin, matrix metallo-proteinase-9 
      (MMP-9), alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and collagen I. Importantly, we found that 
      BLM mice showed higher expression levels of Sting in lung tissues, which were 
      notably restrained by Jug treatment. The role of Jug in suppressing Sting was 
      confirmed in TGF-beta-incubated cells. Notably, the in vitro analysis further showed 
      that Sting knockdown could ameliorate TGF-beta-triggered collagen accumulation. In 
      contrast, TGF-beta-induced fibrosis was accelerated by Sting over-expression. 
      Therefore, BLM may induce lung fibrosis through activating Sting signaling, and 
      Jug could be used therapeutically to improve tissue repair and attenuate the 
      intractable disease.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fibrotic interstitial lung disease with 
      lesions confined to the lungs. To identify meaningful microRNA (miRNA) and gene 
      modules related to the IPF progression, GSE32537 (RNA-sequencing data) and 
      GSE32538 (miRNA-sequencing data) were downloaded and processed, and then weighted 
      gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was applied to construct gene 
      co-expression networks and miRNA co-expression networks. GSE10667, GSE70866, and 
      GSE27430 were used to make a reasonable validation for the results and evaluate 
      the clinical significance of the genes and the miRNAs. Six hub genes (COL3A1, 
      COL1A2, OGN, COL15A1, ASPN, and MXRA5) and seven hub miRNAs (hsa-let-7b-5p, 
      hsa-miR-26a-5p, hsa-miR-25-3p, hsa-miR-29c-3p, hsa-let-7c-5p, hsa-miR-29b-3p, and 
      hsa-miR-26b-5p) were clarified and validated. Meanwhile, iteration network of hub 
      miRNAs-hub genes was constructed, and the emerging role of the network being 
      involved in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was also analyzed by several 
      webtools. The expression levels of hub genes were different between normal lung 
      tissues and NSCLC tissues. Six genes (COL3A1, COL1A2, OGN, COL15A1, ASPN, and 
      MXRA5) and three miRNAs (hsa-miR-29c-3p, hsa-let-7c-5p, and hsa-miR-29b-3p) were 
      related to the survival time of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). The interaction 
      network of hub miRNAs-hub genes might provide common mechanisms involving in IPF 
      and NSCLC. More importantly, useful clues were provided for clinical treatment of 
      both diseases based on novel molecular advances.

AB  - Tetraspanin CD37 has recently received renewed interest as a therapeutic target 
      for B-cell malignancies. Although complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) is a 
      powerful Fc-mediated effector function for killing hematological cancer cells, 
      CD37-specific antibodies are generally poor inducers of CDC. To enhance CDC, the 
      E430G mutation was introduced into humanized CD37 monoclonal IgG1 antibodies to 
      drive more efficient IgG hexamer formation through intermolecular Fc-Fc 
      interactions after cell surface antigen binding. DuoHexaBody-CD37, a bispecific 
      CD37 antibody with the E430G hexamerization-enhancing mutation targeting two 
      non-overlapping epitopes on CD37 (biparatopic), demonstrated potent and superior 
      CDC activity compared to other CD37 antibody variants evaluated, in particular ex 
      vivo in patient-derived chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. The superior CDC 
      potency was attributed to enhanced IgG hexamerization mediated by the E430G 
      mutation in combination with dual epitope targeting. The mechanism of action of 
      DuoHexaBody-CD37 was shown to be multifaceted, as it was additionally capable of 
      inducing efficient antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and 
      antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis in vitro. Finally, potent anti-tumor 
      activity in vivo was observed in cell line- and patient-derived xenograft models 
      from different B-cell malignancy subtypes. These encouraging preclinical results 
      suggest that DuoHexaBody-CD37 (GEN3009) may serve as a potential therapeutic 
      antibody for the treatment of human B-cell malignancies.

TI  - Nintedanib inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition in A549 alveolar epithelial 
      cells through regulation of the TGF-beta/Smad pathway.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fibrotic lung 
      disorder. Recent studies have suggested that epithelial-mesenchymal transition 
      (EMT) of alveolar epithelial cells influences development of pulmonary fibrosis, 
      which is mediated by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta). Tumor necrosis factor 
      alpha (TNF-alpha), an important proinflammatory cytokine in IPF, has been shown to 
      enhance TGF-beta-induced EMT. Nintedanib, a multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor that 
      is currently used to treat IPF, has been shown to suppress EMT in various cancer 
      cell lines. However, the mechanism of EMT inhibition by nintedanib and its effect 
      on TGF-beta and TNF-alpha signaling pathways in alveolar epithelial cells have not been 
      fully elucidated. METHODS: A549 alveolar epithelial cells were stimulated with 
      TGF-beta2 and TNF-alpha, and the effects of nintedanib on global gene expression were 
      evaluated using microarray analysis. Furthermore, Smad2/3 phosphorylation was 
      assessed using western blotting. RESULTS: We found that in A549 cells, TGF-beta2 and 
      TNF-alpha treatment induces EMT, which was inhibited by nintedanib. Gene ontology 
      analysis showed that nintedanib significantly attenuates the gene expression of 
      EMT-related cellular pathways and the TGF-beta signaling pathway, but not in the 
      TNF-alpha-mediated signaling pathway. Furthermore, hierarchical cluster analysis 
      revealed that EMT-related genes were attenuated in nintedanib-treated cells. 
      Additionally, nintedanib was found to markedly suppress phosphorylation of 
      Smad2/3. CONCLUSION: Nintedanib inhibits EMT by mediating EMT-related gene 
      expression and the TGF-beta/Smad pathway in A549 alveolar epithelial cells.

TI  - Proteomic characterization of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients: stable 
      versus acute exacerbation.
LID - 10.4081/monaldi.2020.1231 [doi]
AB  - Acute exacerbations (AEs) are among the main causes of death in idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients. In this study proteomic comparative analysis 
      of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid samples was performed in stable IPF 
      patients versus AEs IPF group to identify AE pathogenetic mechanisms and novel 
      potential predictive biomarkers. A functional proteomic analysis of BAL fluid 
      samples from stable and AE-IPF patients was conducted in a population of 27 IPF 
      patients. Fifty-one differentially abundant spots were observed and identified by 
      mass spectrometry. Enrichment analysis found proteins of interest involved in the 
      regulation of macrophages and lipid metabolism receptors. In acute exacerbation 
      IPF group, differentially abundant proteins were involved in propagation of the 
      beta-catenin WNT transduction signal, and proteins up-regulated in lung 
      carcinogenesis (IGKC, S100A9, PEDF, IGHG1, ALDOA, A1AT, HPT, CO3 and PIGR) and 
      acute phase proteins involved in protease-antiprotease imbalance (such as A1AT 
      fragments). Dot-blot analysis of A1AT C-36 peptide allowed validating our 
      findings, confirming up-regulation in AE IPF patients and suggesting its 
      potential pathogenetic role. A crucial role of protease/antiprotease imbalance, 
      clathrin-mediated endocytosis signalling and carcinogenesis emerged in IPF 
      patients developing acute exacerbations.

AB  - Pirfenidone has been widely used in the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF). However, the role of pirfenidone in LPS-induced acute lung injury 
      (ALI) remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the protective effects of 
      pirfenidone in ALI and to explore its underlying mechanism. Pirfenidone clearly 
      reduces LPS-triggered ALI as indicated by significant pathological alterations, 
      reduced oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in vivo. Furthermore, 
      pirfenidone also blocks apoptosis of LPS-induced alveolar epithelial type II 
      (ATII) cells through inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and 
      mitochondrial injury in vivo and in vitro. A lower expression level of BAP31, an 
      ER transmembrane protein, was found to be associated with ALI followed LPS 
      challenge. The reintroduction of BAP31 blunted LPS induced ER stress and 
      mitochondrial damage and therefore alleviated ATII cell apoptosis, which 
      correlated with pirfenidone treatment. Knockdown of BAP31 expression in 
      pirfenidone treated ATII cells re-activated ER stress, mitochondrial damage and 
      followed cellular apoptosis. In summary, this study confirms the beneficial 
      effect of pirfenidone on ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunction mediated 
      apoptosis via upregulation of BAP31. Our results demonstrated that pirfenidone 
      may be considered as a potential agent for the treatment of ALI in the future.

TI  - Exosomal Long Non-Coding RNAs in Lung Diseases.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21103580 [doi]
LID - 3580
AB  - Within the non-coding genome landscape, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and their 
      secretion within exosomes are a window that could further explain the regulation, 
      the sustaining, and the spread of lung diseases. We present here a compilation of 
      the current knowledge on lncRNAs commonly found in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary 
      Disease (COPD), asthma, Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), or lung cancers. We 
      built interaction networks describing the mechanisms of action for COPD, asthma, 
      and IPF, as well as private networks for H19, MALAT1, MEG3, FENDRR, CDKN2B-AS1, 
      TUG1, HOTAIR, and GAS5 lncRNAs in lung cancers. We identified five signaling 
      pathways targeted by these eight lncRNAs over the lung diseases mentioned above. 
      These lncRNAs were involved in ten treatment resistances in lung cancers, with 
      HOTAIR being itself described in seven resistances. Besides, five of them were 
      previously described as promising biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of 
      asthma, COPD, and lung cancers. Additionally, we describe the exosomal-based 
      studies on H19, MALAT1, HOTAIR, GAS5, UCA1, lnc-MMP2-2, GAPLINC, TBILA, 
      AGAP2-AS1, and SOX2-OT. This review concludes on the need for additional studies 
      describing the lncRNA mechanisms of action and confirming their potential as 
      biomarkers, as well as their involvement in resistance to treatment, especially 
      in non-cancerous lung diseases.

TI  - Association of Common Genetic Variants in the CPSF7 and SDHAF2 Genes with Canine 
      Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis in the West Highland White Terrier.
LID - 10.3390/genes11060609 [doi]
LID - 609
AB  - Canine idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (CIPF) is a chronic fibrotic lung disease 
      that is observed at a higher frequency in the West Highland White Terrier dog 
      breed (WHWT) and may have molecular pathological overlap with human lung fibrotic 
      disease. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in the WHWT using 
      whole genome sequencing (WGS) to discover genetic variants associated with CIPF. 
      Saliva-derived DNA samples were sequenced using the Riptide DNA library prep kit. 
      After quality controls, 28 affected, 44 unaffected, and 1,843,695 informative 
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were included in the GWAS. Data were 
      analyzed both at the single SNP and gene levels using the GEMMA and GATES 
      methods, respectively. We detected significant signals at the gene level in both 
      the cleavage and polyadenylation specific factor 7 (CPSF7) and succinate 
      dehydrogenase complex assembly factor 2 (SDHAF2) genes (adjusted p = 0.016 and 
      0.024, respectively), two overlapping genes located on chromosome 18. The top SNP 
      for both genes was rs22669389; however, it did not reach genome-wide significance 
      in the GWAS (adjusted p = 0.078). Our studies provide, for the first time, 
      candidate loci for CIPF in the WHWT. CPSF7 was recently associated with lung 
      adenocarcinoma, further highlighting the potential relevance of our results 
      because IPF and lung cancer share several pathological mechanisms.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive disease with high 
      mortality that commonly occurs in middle-aged and older adults. IPF, 
      characterized by a decline in lung function, often manifests as exertional 
      dyspnea and cough. Symptoms result from a fibrotic process driven by alveolar 
      epithelial cells that leads to increased migration, proliferation, and 
      differentiation of lung fibroblasts. Ultimately, the differentiation of 
      fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, which synthesize excessive amounts of 
      extracellular matrix proteins, destroys the lung architecture. However, the 
      factors that induce the fibrotic process are unclear. Diagnosis can be a 
      difficult process; the gold standard for diagnosis is the multidisciplinary 
      conference. Practical biomarkers are needed to improve diagnostic and prognostic 
      accuracy. High-resolution computed tomography typically shows interstitial 
      pneumonia with basal and peripheral honeycombing. Gas exchange and diffusion 
      capacity are impaired. Treatments are limited, although the anti-fibrotic drugs 
      pirfenidone and nintedanib can slow the progression of the disease. Lung 
      transplantation is often contraindicated because of age and comorbidities, but it 
      improves survival when successful. The incidence and prevalence of IPF has been 
      increasing and there is an urgent need for improved therapies. This review covers 
      the detailed cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying IPF progression as well 
      as current treatments and cutting-edge research into new therapeutic targets.

TI  - Protein tyrosine phosphatase-alpha amplifies transforming growth factor-beta-dependent 
      profibrotic signaling in lung fibroblasts.
PG  - L294-L311

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, often fatal, fibrosing lung 
      disease for which treatment remains suboptimal. Fibrogenic cytokines, including 
      transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), are central to its pathogenesis. Protein 
      tyrosine phosphatase-alpha (PTPalpha) has emerged as a key regulator of fibrogenic 
      signaling in fibroblasts. We have reported that mice globally deficient in PTPalpha 
      (Ptpra(-/-)) were protected from experimental pulmonary fibrosis, in part via 
      alterations in TGF-beta signaling. The goal of this study was to determine the lung 
      cell types and mechanisms by which PTPalpha controls fibrogenic pathways and whether 
      these pathways are relevant to human disease. Immunohistochemical analysis of 
      lungs from patients with IPF revealed that PTPalpha was highly expressed by 
      mesenchymal cells in fibroblastic foci and by airway and alveolar epithelial 
      cells. To determine whether PTPalpha promotes profibrotic signaling pathways in lung 
      fibroblasts and/or epithelial cells, we generated mice with conditional (floxed) 
      Ptpra alleles (Ptpra(f/f)). These mice were crossed with Dermo1-Cre or with 
      Sftpc-CreER(T2) mice to delete Ptpra in mesenchymal cells and alveolar type II 
      cells, respectively. Dermo1-Cre/Ptpra(f/f) mice were protected from 
      bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, whereas Sftpc-CreER(T2)/Ptpra(f/f) mice 
      developed pulmonary fibrosis equivalent to controls. Both canonical and 
      noncanonical TGF-beta signaling and downstream TGF-beta-induced fibrogenic responses 
      were attenuated in isolated Ptpra(-/-) compared with wild-type fibroblasts. 
      Furthermore, TGF-beta-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of TGF-beta type II receptor and 
      of PTPalpha were attenuated in Ptpra(-/-) compared with wild-type fibroblasts. The 
      phenotype of cells genetically deficient in PTPalpha was recapitulated with the use 
      of a Src inhibitor. These findings suggest that PTPalpha amplifies profibrotic 
      TGF-beta-dependent pathway signaling in lung fibroblasts.

AB  - AIMS: To investigate the effect and underlying mechanism of melittin and 
      tripartite motif (TRIM) family in human embryonic lung fibroblast (HELF). 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lentiviral RNA interference vector and lentiviral 
      overexpression vector were constructed and packaged by transfecting 293T cells; 
      the proliferation of HELF was examined using Cell Counting Kit 8; Western blot 
      and qRT-PCR were performed to examine protein and mRNA expression; the 
      interaction with protein phosphatase magnesium-dependent 1A (PPM1A) was examined 
      by Co-immunoprecipitation. KEY FINDINGS: Compared with the control group, the 
      mRNA expression of the TRIM6, TRIM8 and TRIM47 in the IPF group significantly 
      increased. Melittin inhibited the mRNA expression and protein expression levels 
      of TRIM47, the HELF proliferation, the hydroxyproline levels, and the 
      phosphorylation of Smad2/3; the interference of TRIM47 inhibited the protein 
      expression of Vimentin, alpha-SMA, CTGF, the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and the 
      synthesis of hydroxyproline; TRIM47 overexpression elevated the phosphorylation 
      of Smad2/3, induced ubiquitination of PPM1A and decreased the expression level of 
      PPM1A, while TRIM47 RNA interference reversed this result. SIGNIFICANCE: Melittin 
      has anti-fibrotic effect in HELF by directly reducing the phosphorylation of 
      Smad2/3 or indirectly reducing the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 by decreasing the 
      expression levels of TRIM47 whose overexpression induces ubiquitination of PPM1A.

      nintedanib therapy.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal progressive disease with a median 
      survival of 2-5 years. Nintedanib is a small tyrosine kinase inhibitor that 
      reduces IPF progression, significantly slowing the annual decline in Forced Vital 
      Capacity (FVC). Very little data is available on the molecular mechanisms of this 
      treatment in IPF, despite a growing interest in the definition of IPF 
      pathogenesis and target therapy. A functional proteomic approach was applied to 
      the analysis of serum samples from IPF patients in order to highlight 
      differential proteins potentially indicative of drug-induced molecular pathways 
      modifications and response to therapy. Twelve serum samples were collected from 
      six IPF patients in care at Siena Regional Referral Center for Interstitial Lung 
      Diseases (ILDs) and treated with nintedanib for one year. Serum samples were 
      analyzed at baseline (T0 before starting therapy) and after one year of treatment 
      (T1) and underwent differential proteomic and bioinformatic analysis. Proteomic 
      analysis revealed 13 protein species that were significantly increased after one 
      year of treatment. When the targets of nintedanib (VEGFR, FGFR and PDGFR) were 
      added, enrichment analysis extracted molecular pathways and process networks 
      involved in cell differentiation (haptoglobin and albumin), coagulation 
      (antithrombin III), epithelial mesenchymal transition, cell proliferation and 
      transmigration. PI3K and MAPK induced up-regulation of apolipoprotein C3. 
      Proteomic study found 13 protein species up-regulated in IPF patients after one 
      year of nintedanib treatment. Haptoglobin, a central hub of our analysis was 
      validated by 2D-WB and ELISA as theranostic marker in a more numerous populations 
      of patients.

AB  - Asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF) are three serious lung inflammatory diseases. The understanding of 
      the pathogenesis mechanism and the identification of potential prognostic 
      biomarkers of these diseases can provide the patients with more efficient 
      treatments. In this study, an efficient hybrid feature selection method was 
      introduced in order to extract informative genes. We implemented an 
      ontology-based ranking approach on differentially expressed genes following a 
      wrapper method. The examination of the different gene ontologies and their 
      combinations motivated us to propose a biological functional-based method to 
      improve the performance of further wrapper methods. The results identified: 
      TOM1L1, SRSF1, and GIT2 in asthma; CHCHD4, PAIP2, CRLF3, UBQLN4, TRAK1, PRELID1, 
      VAMP4, CCM2, and APBB1IP in COPD; and TUFT1, GAB2, B4GALNT1, TNFRSF17, PRDM8, and 
      SETDB2 in IPF as the potential biomarkers. The proposed method can be used to 
      identify hub genes in other high-throughput datasets.

      Pathways.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21124257 [doi]
LID - 4257
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive lung disease of unknown 
      etiology characterized by distorted distal lung architecture, inflammation, and 
      fibrosis. The molecular mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of IPF are 
      incompletely defined. Several lung cell types including alveolar epithelial 
      cells, fibroblasts, monocyte-derived macrophages, and endothelial cells have been 
      implicated in the development and progression of fibrosis. Regardless of the cell 
      types involved, changes in gene expression, disrupted glycolysis, and 
      mitochondrial oxidation, dysregulated protein folding, and altered phospholipid 
      and sphingolipid metabolism result in activation of myofibroblast, deposition of 
      extracellular matrix proteins, remodeling of lung architecture and fibrosis. 
      Lipid mediators derived from phospholipids, sphingolipids, and polyunsaturated 
      fatty acids play an important role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis and 
      have been described to exhibit pro- and anti-fibrotic effects in IPF and in 
      preclinical animal models of lung fibrosis. This review describes the current 
      understanding of the role and signaling pathways of prostanoids, 
      lysophospholipids, and sphingolipids and their metabolizing enzymes in the 
      development of lung fibrosis. Further, several of the lipid mediators and enzymes 
      involved in their metabolism are therapeutic targets for drug development to 
      treat IPF.

AB  - A significant proportion - up to 40 % - of patients suffering from fibrosing 
      interstitial pneumonia will acquire a progressive phenotype which shares genetic 
      and pathogenic mechanisms, as well a clinical behavior similar to those of 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). It therefore makes sense to suggest that 
      molecules with antifibrotic properties such as pirfenidone and nintedanib could 
      be effective in patients with progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease as 
      they are in patients with IPF. The first studies published on this topic show 
      encouraging results which however have to be confirmed on a larger scale.

AB  - Cytokine storm, multiorgan failure, and particularly acute respiratory distress 
      syndrome (ARDS) is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with 
      COVID-19. A fulminant ARDS kills the majority of COVID-19 victims. Pirfenidone 
      (5-methyl-1-phenyl-2-[1H]-pyridone), is a novel anti-fibrotic agent with trivial 
      adverse effects. Pirfenidone is approved for the treatment of Idiopathic 
      Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) for patients with mild to moderate disease. Pirfenidone 
      could inhibit apoptosis, downregulate ACE receptors expression, decrease 
      inflammation by several mechanisms and ameliorate oxidative stress and hence 
      protect pneumocytes and other cells from COVID-19 invasion and cytokine storm 
      simultaneously. Based on the pirfenidone mechanism of action and the known 
      pathophysiology of COVID-19, I believe that pirfenidone has the potential for the 
      treatment of COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic scarring disease in which aging, 
      environmental exposure(s) and genetic susceptibility have been implicated in 
      disease pathogenesis, however, the causes and mechanisms of the progressive 
      fibrotic cascade are still poorly understood. As epithelial-mesenchymal 
      interactions are essential for normal wound healing, through human 2D and 3D in 
      vitro studies, we tested the hypothesis that IPF fibroblasts (IPFFs) dysregulate 
      alveolar epithelial homeostasis. Conditioned media from IPFFs exaggerated the 
      wound-healing response of primary human Type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECs). 
      Furthermore, AECs co-cultured with IPFFs exhibited irregular epithelialization 
      compared with those co-cultured with control fibroblasts (NHLFs) or AECs alone, 
      suggesting that epithelial homeostasis is dysregulated in IPF as a consequence of 
      the abnormal secretory phenotype of IPFFs. Secretome analysis of IPFF conditioned 
      media and functional studies identified the matricellular protein, SPARC, as a 
      key mediator in the epithelial-mesenchymal paracrine signaling, with increased 
      secretion of SPARC by IPFFs promoting persistent activation of alveolar 
      epithelium via an integrin/focal adhesion/cellular-junction axis resulting in 
      disruption of epithelial barrier integrity and increased macromolecular 
      permeability. These findings suggest that in IPF fibroblast paracrine signaling 
      promotes persistent alveolar epithelial activation, so preventing normal 
      epithelial repair responses and restoration of tissue homeostasis. Furthermore, 
      they identify SPARC-mediated paracrine signaling as a potential therapeutic 
      target to promote the restoration of lung epithelial homoestasis in IPF patients.

AB  - The excessive activation and proliferation of lung fibroblasts are responsible 
      for the abundant deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) in idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF), while its specific mechanism is still unknown. This study focuses 
      on the role of circRNA (circ) TADA2A in functional abnormalities of lung 
      fibroblasts and aims to elaborate its regulatory mechanism. In the present study, 
      circTADA2A was downregulated in both IPF primary human lung fibroblasts and human 
      IPF fibroblastic cell lines. Functionally, the overexpression of circTADA2A 
      repressed the activation and proliferation of normal human fibroblastic cell line 
      induced by several fibrogenic growth factors. Using fluorescence in situ 
      hybridization (FISH), luciferase reporter assays, and RNA pull-down, circTADA2A 
      was confirmed to function as sponges of miR-526b and miR-203, thus releasing the 
      expression of Caveolin (Cav)-1 and Cav2. The overexpression of circTADA2A 
      suppressed lung-fibroblasts activation via Cav1 and reduced lung-fibroblasts 
      proliferation via Cav2. In vivo experiments also confirmed that the 
      overexpression of circTADA2A decreased fibrogenic responses induced by bleomycin 
      in lung-fibrosis mice. Collectively, circTADA2A repressed lung-fibroblasts 
      activation via miR-526b/Cav1 and reduced lung-fibroblasts proliferation via 
      miR-203/Cav2, thus inhibiting the excessive deposition of ECM and relieving IPF.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and heterogeneous 
      interstitial lung disease of unknown origin with a low survival rate. There are 
      few treatment options available due to the fact that mechanisms underlying 
      disease progression are not well understood, likely because they arise from 
      dysregulation of complex signaling networks spanning multiple tissue 
      compartments. To better characterize these networks, we used systems-focused 
      data-driven modeling approaches to identify cross-tissue compartment (blood and 
      bronchoalveolar lavage) and temporal proteomic signatures that differentiated IPF 
      progressors and non-progressors. Partial least squares discriminant analysis 
      identified a signature of 54 baseline (week 0) blood and lung proteins that 
      differentiated IPF progression status by the end of 80 weeks of follow-up with 
      100% cross-validation accuracy. Overall we observed heterogeneous protein 
      expression patterns in progressors compared to more homogenous signatures in 
      non-progressors, and found that non-progressors were enriched for proteomic 
      processes involving regulation of the immune/defense response. We also identified 
      a temporal signature of blood proteins that was significantly different at early 
      and late progressor time points (p < 0.0001), but not present in non-progressors. 
      Overall, this approach can be used to generate new hypothesis for mechanisms 
      associated with IPF progression and could readily be translated to other complex 
      and heterogeneous diseases.

TI  - Synonymous Mutation in DKC1 Causes Telomerase RNA Insufficiency Manifesting as 
      Familial Pulmonary Fibrosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most common of short 
      telomere phenotypes. Familial clustering of IPF is common, but the genetic basis 
      remains unknown in more than one-half of cases. We identified a 65-year-old man 
      with familial IPF, short telomere length, and low telomerase RNA levels. He was 
      diagnosed with a short telomere syndrome after developing hematologic 
      complications post-lung transplantation, but no mutations were identified in a 
      clinical testing pipeline. RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the molecular basis 
      underlying the familial IPF and low telomerase RNA levels in this patient? STUDY 
      DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed whole-genome sequence data and performed 
      functional molecular studies on cells derived from the patient and his family. 
      RESULTS: We identified a previously unreported synonymous variant c.942G>A 
      p.K314K in DKC1, the gene encoding the dyskerin ribonucleoprotein, which is 
      required for telomerase RNA biogenesis. The mutation created a competing de novo 
      exonic splicing enhancer, and the misspliced product was degraded by 
      nonsense-mediated decay causing an overall dyskerin deficiency in mutation 
      carriers. In silico tools identified other rare silent DKC1 variants that warrant 
      functional evaluation if found in patients with short telomere-mediated disease. 
      INTERPRETATION: Our data point to silent mutation in telomere maintenance genes 
      as a mechanism of familial pulmonary fibrosis. In contrast to DKC1 missense 
      mutations, which primarily manifest in children as dyskeratosis congenita, 
      hypomorphic mutations affecting dyskerin levels likely have a predilection to 
      presenting in adults as pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating interstitial lung disease 
      with irreversible loss of lung tissue and function. Myofibroblasts in the lung 
      are key cellular mediators of IPF progression. Transforming growth factor 
      (TGF)-beta1, a major profibrogenic cytokine, induces pulmonary myofibroblast 
      differentiation, and emerging evidence has established the importance of 
      microRNAs (miRs) in the development of IPF. The objective of this study was to 
      define the pro-fibrotic roles and mechanisms of miRs in TGF-beta1-induced pulmonary 
      myofibroblast differentiation. Using RNA sequencing, we identified miR-424 as an 
      important TGF-beta1-induced miR in human lung fibroblasts (HLFs). Quantitative 
      RT-PCR confirmed that miR-424 expression was increased by 2.6-fold in HLFs in 
      response to TGF-beta1 and was 1.7-fold higher in human fibrotic lung tissues as 
      compared to non-fibrotic lung tissues. TGF-beta1-induced upregulation of miR-424 was 
      blocked by the Smad3 inhibitor SIS3, suggesting the involvement of this canonical 
      TGF-beta1 signaling pathway. Transfection of a miR-424 hairpin inhibitor into HLFs 
      reduced TGF-beta1-induced expression of classic myofibroblast differentiation 
      markers including a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) and connective tissue growth 
      factor (CTGF), whereas a miR-424 mimic significantly enhanced TGF-beta1-induced 
      myofibroblast differentiation. In addition, TGF-beta1 induced Smad3 phosphorylation 
      in HLFs, and this response was reduced by the miR-424 inhibitor. In silico 
      analysis identified Slit2, a protein that inhibits TGF-beta1 profibrogenic 
      signaling, as a putative target of regulation by miR-424. Slit2 is less highly 
      expressed in human fibrotic lung tissues than in non-fibrotic lung tissues, and 
      knockdown of Slit2 by its siRNA enhanced TGF-beta1-induced HLF differentiation. 
      Overexpression of a miR-424 mimic down-regulated expression of Slit2 but not the 
      Slit2 major receptor ROBO1 in HLFs. Luciferase reporter assays showed that the 
      miR-424 mimic represses Slit2 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) reporter activity, 
      and mutations at the seeding regions in the 3'-UTR of Slit2 abolish this 
      inhibition. Together, these data demonstrate a pro-fibrotic role of miR-424 in 
      TGF-beta1-induced HLF differentiation. It functions as a positive feed-back 
      regulator of the TGF-beta1 signaling pathway by reducing expression of the negative 
      regulator Slit2. Thus, targeting miR-424 may provide a new therapeutic strategy 
      to prevent myofibroblast differentiation and IPF progression.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a specific form of chronic, progressive 
      and fibrosing interstitial pneumonia of unknown cause. The main feature of IPF is 
      a heterogeneous appearance with areas of sub-pleural fibrosis. However, the 
      mechanism of sub-pleural fibrosis was poorly understood. In this study, our in 
      vivo study revealed that pleural mesothelial cells (PMCs) migrated into lung 
      parenchyma and localized alongside lung fibroblasts in sub-pleural area in mouse 
      pulmonary fibrosis. Our in vitro study displayed that cultured-PMCs-medium 
      induced lung fibroblasts transforming into myofibroblast, 
      cultured-fibroblasts-medium promoted mesothelial-mesenchymal transition of PMCs. 
      Furthermore, these changes in lung fibroblasts and PMCs were prevented by 
      blocking TGF-beta1/Smad2/3 signaling with SB431542. TGF-beta1 neutralized antibody 
      attenuated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Similar to TGF-beta1/Smad2/3 
      signaling, wnt/beta-catenin signaling was also activated in the process of PMCs 
      crosstalk with lung fibroblasts. Moreover, inhibition of CD147 attenuated 
      cultured-PMCs-medium induced collagen-I synthesis in lung fibroblasts. Blocking 
      CD147 signaling also prevented bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Our data 
      indicated that crosstalk between PMC and lung fibroblast contributed to 
      sub-pleural pulmonary fibrosis. TGF-beta1, Wnt/beta-catenin and CD147 signaling was 
      involved in the underling mechanism.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fibroblast dysfunction is the main pathogenic mechanism of idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). S100 calcium-binding protein A4 (S100A4) plays critical 
      roles in the proliferation of fibroblasts and in the development of pulmonary, 
      hepatic, and renal fibrosis. However, the clinical implications of S100A4 in IPF 
      have not been evaluated. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The S100A4 mRNA and protein 
      levels were measured by real-time PCR and immunoblotting in fibroblasts from IPF 
      patients and controls. The S100A4 level was measured by enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from the normal 
      controls (NCs; n = 33) and from patients with IPF (n = 87), non-specific 
      interstitial pneumonia (NSIP; n = 22), hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP; n = 19), 
      and sarcoidosis (n = 9). S100A4 localization was evaluated by immunofluorescence 
      staining. RESULTS: The S100A4 mRNA and protein levels were significantly higher 
      in fibroblasts from IPF patients (n = 14) than in those from controls (n = 10, 
      p < 0.001). The S100A4 protein level in BALF was significantly higher in the IPF 
      (89.25 [49.92-203.02 pg/mL]), NSIP (74.53 [41.88-131.45 pg/mL]), HP (222.36 
      [104.92-436.92 pg/mL]) and sarcoidosis (101.62 [59.36-300.62 pg/mL]) patients 
      than in the NCs (7.57 [1.31-14.04 pg/mL], p < 0.01, respectively). Cutoff S100A4 
      levels of 18.85 and 28.88 pg/mL had 87.4% and 87.8% accuracy, respectively, for 
      discriminating IPF and other lung diseases from NCs. CONCLUSIONS: S100A4 is 
      expressed by alpha-SMA-positive cells in the interstitium of the IPF patients. S100A4 
      may participate in the development of IPF, and its protein level may be a 
      candidate diagnostic and therapeutic marker for IPF.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fibrotic lung disease 
      without effective therapy. Animal models effectively reproducing IPF disease 
      features are needed to study the underlying molecular mechanisms. Tree shrews are 
      genetically, anatomically, and metabolically closer to humans than rodents or 
      dogs; therefore, the tree shrew model presents a unique opportunity for 
      translational research in lung fibrosis. Here we demonstrate that tree shrews 
      have in vivo and in vitro fibrotic responses induced by bleomycin and 
      pro-fibrotic mediators. Bleomycin exposure induced lung fibrosis evidenced by 
      histological and biochemical fibrotic changes. In primary tree shrew lung 
      fibroblasts, transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta1) induced myofibroblast 
      differentiation, increased extracellular matrix (ECM) protein production, and 
      focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activation. Tree shrew lung fibroblasts showed 
      enhanced migration and increased matrix invasion in response to platelet derived 
      growth factor BB (PDGF-BB). Inhibition of FAK significantly attenuated 
      pro-fibrotic responses in lung fibroblasts. The data demonstrate that tree shrews 
      have in vivo and in vitro fibrotic responses similar to that observed in IPF. The 
      data, for the first time, support that the tree shrew model of lung fibrosis is a 
      new and promising experimental animal model for studying the pathophysiology and 
      therapeutics of lung fibrosis.

TI  - Metabolic Dysregulation in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21165663 [doi]
LID - 5663
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fibroproliferative disorder limited to 
      the lung. New findings, starting from our proteomics studies on IPF, suggest that 
      systemic involvement with altered molecular mechanisms and metabolic disorder is 
      an underlying cause of fibrosis. The role of metabolic dysregulation in the 
      pathogenesis of IPF has not been extensively studied, despite a recent surge of 
      interest. In particular, our studies on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid have shown 
      that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), the hypoxia/oxidative 
      stress response, and changes in iron and lipid metabolism are involved in onset 
      of IPF. These processes appear to interact in an intricate manner and to be 
      related to different fibrosing pathologies not directly linked to the lung 
      environment. The disordered metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and 
      hormones has been documented in lung, liver, and kidney fibrosis. Correcting 
      these metabolic alterations may offer a new strategy for treating fibrosis. This 
      paper focuses on the role of metabolic dysregulation in the pathogenesis of IPF 
      and is a continuation of our previous studies, investigating metabolic 
      dysregulation as a new target for fibrosis therapy.

TI  - Carrot Anthocyanins Genetics and Genomics: Status and Perspectives to Improve Its 
      Application for the Food Colorant Industry.
LID - 10.3390/genes11080906 [doi]
LID - 906
AB  - Purple or black carrots (Daucus carota ssp. sativus var. atrorubens Alef) are 
      characterized by their dark purple- to black-colored roots, owing their 
      appearance to high anthocyanin concentrations. In recent years, there has been 
      increasing interest in the use of black carrot anthocyanins as natural food dyes. 
      Black carrot roots contain large quantities of mono-acylated anthocyanins, which 
      impart a measure of heat-, light- and pH-stability, enhancing the color-stability 
      of food products over their shelf-life. The genetic pathway controlling 
      anthocyanin biosynthesis appears well conserved among land plants; however, 
      different variants of anthocyanin-related genes between cultivars results in 
      tissue-specific accumulations of purple pigments. Thus, broad genetic variations 
      of anthocyanin profile, and tissue-specific distributions in carrot tissues and 
      organs, can be observed, and the ratio of acylated to non-acylated anthocyanins 
      varies significantly in the purple carrot germplasm. Additionally, anthocyanins 
      synthesis can also be influenced by a wide range of external factors, such as 
      abiotic stressors and/or chemical elicitors, directly affecting the anthocyanin 
      yield and stability potential in food and beverage applications. In this study, 
      we critically review and discuss the current knowledge on anthocyanin diversity, 
      genetics and the molecular mechanisms controlling anthocyanin accumulation in 
      carrots. We also provide a view of the current knowledge gaps and advancement 
      needs as regards developing and applying innovative molecular tools to improve 
      the yield, product performance and stability of carrot anthocyanin for use as a 
      natural food colorant.

TI  - Astaxanthin attenuates pulmonary fibrosis through lncITPF and 
      mitochondria-mediated signal pathways.
PG  - 10245-10250
LID - 10.1111/jcmm.15477 [doi]
AB  - Pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic interstitial lung disease characterized by 
      pulmonary epithelial injury, fibroblast activation, extracellular matrix 
      deposition, and tissue structure destruction. However, an effective drug 
      treatment remains unavailable. Therefore, studying the mechanism of pulmonary 
      fibrogenesis and finding effective drugs have become important problems in the 
      field of respiratory diseases. Pulmonary fibrosis is typically characterized by 
      activated fibroblast proliferation and migration. Hence, abnormality in activated 
      fibroblast proliferation and migration is a major concern for treating pulmonary 
      fibrosis. Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is an enigmatic subclass of ncRNA that 
      regulates various fundamental biological processes and participates in disease 
      occurrence and development. However, studies on lncRNA as the therapeutic target 
      of drug action are rarely reported. Our group first identified differentially 
      expressed lncRNAs and revealed that lncITPF is a highly upregulated lncRNA in 
      lung fibrosis. In particular, lncITPF is detected in the blood of patients with 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Clinical analysis shows that lncITPF is positively 
      correlated with the degree of fibrosis. The receiver operating characteristic 
      (ROC) curve indicates that the specificity and sensitivity values are 95.0 and 
      64.3, respectively. The area under the ROC curve is 0.804, indicating that 
      lncITPF can be a diagnostic biomarker for IPF. However, whether lncITPF is 
      effective as a therapeutic target of drug action against pulmonary fibrosis 
      remains unclear. In this study, lncITPF acting as the therapeutic target of 
      astaxanthin was explored in depth. The findings elucidated that astaxanthin 
      blocks the activated fibroblast proliferation and migration through lncITPF and 
      mitochondria-mediated signal pathways to alleviate pulmonary fibrogenesis.

AB  - Increased metabolism distinguishes myofibroblasts or fibrotic lung fibroblasts 
      (fLfs) from the normal lung fibroblasts (nLfs). The mechanism of metabolic 
      activation in fLfs has not been fully elucidated. Furthermore, the antifibrogenic 
      effects of caveolin-1 scaffolding domain peptide CSP/CSP7 involving metabolic 
      reprogramming in fLfs are unclear. We therefore analyzed lactate and succinate 
      levels, as well as the expression of glycolytic enzymes and hypoxia inducible 
      factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha). Lactate and succinate levels, as well as the basal expression 
      of glycolytic enzymes and HIF-1alpha, were increased in fLfs. These changes were 
      reversed following restoration of p53 or its transcriptional target microRNA-34a 
      (miR-34a) expression in fLfs. Conversely, inhibition of basal p53 or miR-34a 
      increased glucose metabolism, glycolytic enzymes, and HIF-1alpha in nLfs. Treatment 
      of fLfs or mice having bleomycin- or Ad-TGF-beta1-induced lung fibrosis with 
      CSP/CSP7 reduced the expression of glycolytic enzymes and HIF-1alpha. Furthermore, 
      inhibition of p53 or miR-34a abrogated CSP/CSP7-mediated restoration of 
      glycolytic flux in fLfs in vitro and in mice with pulmonary fibrosis and lacking 
      p53 or miR-34a expression in fibroblasts in vivo. Our data indicate that 
      dysregulation of glucose metabolism in fLfs is causally linked to loss of basal 
      expression of p53 and miR-34a. Treatment with CSP/CSP7 constrains aberrant 
      glucose metabolism through restoration of p53 and miR-34a.

AB  - The preservation of cellular homeostasis requires the synthesis of new proteins 
      (proteostasis) and organelles, and the effective removal of misfolded or impaired 
      proteins and cellular debris. This cellular homeostasis involves two key 
      proteostasis mechanisms, the ubiquitin proteasome system and the 
      autophagy-lysosome pathway. These catabolic pathways have been known to be 
      involved in respiratory exacerbations and the pathogenesis of various lung 
      diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis 
      (CF), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), acute lung injury (ALI), acute 
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). 
      Briefly, proteostasis and autophagy processes are known to decline over time with 
      age, cigarette or biomass smoke exposure, and/or influenced by underlying genetic 
      factors, resulting in the accumulation of misfolded proteins and cellular debris, 
      elevating apoptosis and cellular senescence, and initiating the pathogenesis of 
      acute or chronic lung disease. Moreover, autophagic dysfunction results in an 
      impaired microbial clearance, post-bacterial and/or viral infection(s) which 
      contribute to the initiation of acute and recurrent respiratory exacerbations as 
      well as the progression of chronic obstructive and restrictive lung diseases. In 
      addition, the autophagic dysfunction-mediated cystic fibrosis transmembrane 
      conductance regulator (CFTR) immune response impairment further exacerbates the 
      lung disease. Recent studies demonstrate the therapeutic potential of novel 
      autophagy augmentation strategies, in alleviating the pathogenesis of chronic 
      obstructive or restrictive lung diseases and exacerbations such as those commonly 
      seen in COPD, CF, ALI/ARDS and COVID-19.

AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in organ fibrosis and various pulmonary 
      diseases, but its role in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is not fully 
      understood. In this study, we found lncRNA Hoxaas3 (Hoxaas3) was up-regulated in 
      the mice model of BLM-induced PF and TGF-beta1-induced fibrogenesis in lung 
      fibroblasts (LF). Overexpression of Hoxaas3 promoted fibrogenesis, whereas 
      Hoxaas3 inhibition attenuated lung fibrosis both in vitro and in vivo, through 
      regulation of miR-450b-5p. Furthermore, miR-450b-5p inhibition stimulated 
      fibrogenesis by regulating runt-related transcription factor 1 (Runx1), whereas 
      up-regulation of miR-450b-5p alleviated fibrogenesis in LF. Mechanistically, our 
      study showed that Hoxaas3 regulated lung fibroblast activation and fibrogenesis 
      by acting as a competing endogenous RNA for miR-450b-5p: Hoxaas3 decreased the 
      expression of miR-450b-5p to stimulate level and activity of Runx1 and induced 
      fibrotic LF, whereas Runx1 inhibition alleviated the pro-fibrotic effect of 
      Hoxaas3. In addition, Hoxaas3 was regulated by TGF-beta1/Smad4 pathway as its 
      transcriptional target. In conclusion, our study showed the role and mechanism of 
      the TGF-beta1/Smad4- Hoxaas3-miR-450b-5p-Runx1 axis for a better understanding of 
      PF, demonstrated Hoxaas3 maybe a new diagnostic biomarker or potential 
      therapeutic target for IPF.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an interstitial lung disease (ILD) sharing 
      various genetic, molecular and cell processes with lung cancer (LC). Nintedanib, 
      a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor, was first developed as an anticancer drug because it 
      suppresses angiogenesis. It was then recognized as an anti-fibrotic agent and 
      approved for the treatment of IPF. On the basis of in vitro studies of the drug, 
      we performed a bioinformatic analysis of all targeted tyrosine kinases with the 
      aim of highlighting common molecular pathways modulated by the drug in LC and 
      IPF. The results show that MAPK, PI3K/AKT, JAK/STAT, TGF-beta, VEGF and 
      WNT/beta-catenin signalling are the main molecular pathways modulated by the drug. 
      Interestingly, these pathways include that controlled by intercellular adherence 
      junctions (compromised in LC and IPF), and by central carbon metabolism (usually 
      studied more in relation to the pathogenesis of cancer than IPF). On the basis of 
      the tyrosine kinases considered, our bioinformatic analysis highlighted five 
      microRNAs influencing VEGF-A signalling and epithelial to mesenchymal transition 
      mechanisms. Comparison of our results with those of previous studies highlighted 
      correlations between microRNAs and the development of LC and IPF.

TI  - MiR-200a inversely correlates with Hedgehog and TGF-beta canonical/non-canonical 
      trajectories to orchestrate the anti-fibrotic effect of Tadalafil in a

PG  - 167-182

AB  - Few reports have documented the ability of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors 
      (PDE-5-Is) to ameliorate idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) mainly by their 
      anti-inflammatory/antioxidant capacities, without unveiling the possible 
      molecular mechanisms involved. Because of the recent role of miR-200 family and 
      Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) trajectory in IPF, we have studied their impact on the 
      anti-fibrotic potential of tadalafil against bleomycin-induced pulmonary 
      fibrosis. Animals were allocated into normal-control, bleomycin-fibrotic control, 
      and bleomycin post-treated with tadalafil or dexamethasone, as the reference 
      drug. On the molecular level, tadalafil has reverted the bleomycin effect on all 
      the assessed parameters. Tadalafil upregulated the gene expression of miR-200a, 
      but decreased the smoothened (SMO) and the transcription factors 
      glioma-associated oncogene homolog (Gli-1, Gli-2), members of SHH pathway. 
      Additionally, tadalafil ebbed transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, its canonical 
      (SMAD-3/alpha smooth muscle actin [alpha-SMA] and Snail), and non-canonical 
      (p-Akt/p-Forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) a) pathways. Besides, a strong negative 
      correlation between miR-200a and the analyzed pathways was proved. The effect of 
      tadalafil was further confirmed by the improved lung structure and the reduced 
      Ashcroft score/collagen deposition. The results were comparable to that of 
      dexamethasone. In conclusion, our study has highlighted the involvement of 
      miR-200a in the anti-fibrotic effect of tadalafil with the inhibition of SHH hub 
      and the pro-fibrotic pathways (TGF-beta/ SMAD-3/alpha-SMA, Snail and p-AKT/p-FOXO3a).

AB  - Pulmonary fibrosis is the end stage of many interstitial lung diseases, 
      characterized by the deposition of excess extracellular matrix (ECM), destruction 
      of normal alveolar structure, and resulting in the obstruction of gas exchange 
      and respiratory failure. The idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most 
      common form of pulmonary fibrosis with little effective therapies. 
      5-Methoxytryptophan (5-MTP) is a newly found tryptophan metabolite. Previous 
      studies suggested that 5-MTP has the effects of anti-inflammatory, 
      anti-tumorigenesis, vascular protection and anti-fibrosis in renal disease. 
      Whether 5-MTP has therapeutic effect on pulmonary fibrosis is not clear. In our 
      study, we used TGF-beta1 to stimulate human lung fibroblasts (HLFs) and bleomycin 
      (BLM) induced pulmonary fibrosis model to investigate the effect of 5-MTP on 
      pulmonary fibrosis. Our study demonstrated that 5-MTP could improve the lung 
      function and attenuate the destruction of alveolar structure in BLM-induced 
      pulmonary fibrosis mice. Furthermore, 5-MTP significantly decreased accumulation 
      of myofibroblasts and the deposition of ECM by inhibiting the differentiation of 
      fibroblasts to myofibroblasts and suppressing the protein expression of the ECM 
      both in vivo and in vitro. Our results also revealed 5-MTP could inhibit the 
      proliferation and migration of the fibroblasts in vitro, which played an 
      important role in the progressive pulmonary fibrosis. To further investigate the 
      mechanism of the anti-fibrosis of 5-MTP, several canonical and noncanonical 
      signaling pathways were examined. Our results revealed that 5-MTP could inhibit 
      the pulmonary fibrosis through downregulating the phosphorylation of TGF-beta/SMAD3, 
      PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. Together, our study indicated that 5-MTP promises to 
      be therapeutic agent of pulmonary fibrosis.

TI  - Transcriptomic Evaluation of Pulmonary Fibrosis-Related Genes: Utilization of 
      Transgenic Mice with Modifying p38 Signal in the Lungs.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21186746 [doi]
LID - 6746
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fibrosing lung disease that 
      is caused by the dysregulation of alveolar epithelial type II cells (AEC II). The 
      mechanisms involved in the progression of IPF remain incompletely understood, 
      although the immune response accompanied by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase 
      (MAPK) activation may contribute to some of them. This study aimed to examine the 
      association of p38 activity in the lungs with bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary 
      fibrosis and its transcriptomic profiling. Accordingly, we evaluated BLM-induced 
      pulmonary fibrosis during an active fibrosis phase in three genotypes of mice 
      carrying stepwise variations in intrinsic p38 activity in the AEC II and 
      performed RNA sequencing of their lungs. Stepwise elevation of p38 signaling in 
      the lungs of the three genotypes was correlated with increased severity of 
      BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis exhibiting reduced static compliance and higher 
      collagen content. Transcriptome analysis of these lung samples also showed that 
      the enhanced p38 signaling in the lungs was associated with increased 
      transcription of the genes driving the p38 MAPK pathway and differentially 
      expressed genes elicited by BLM, including those related to fibrosis as well as 
      the immune system. Our findings underscore the significance of p38 MAPK in the 
      progression of pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - Evidence points to an indispensable function of macrophages in tissue 
      regeneration, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here we 
      demonstrate a protective function for the IL-33-ST2 axis in bronchial epithelial 
      repair, and implicate ST2 in myeloid cell differentiation. ST2 deficiency in mice 
      leads to reduced lung myeloid cell infiltration, abnormal alternatively activated 
      macrophage (AAM) function, and impaired epithelial repair post 
      naphthalene-induced injury. Reconstitution of wild type (WT) AAMs to 
      ST2-deficient mice completely restores bronchial re-epithelialization. Central to 
      this mechanism is the direct effect of IL-33-ST2 signaling on monocyte/macrophage 
      differentiation, self-renewal and repairing ability, as evidenced by the 
      downregulation of key pathways regulating myeloid cell cycle, maturation and 
      regenerative function of the epithelial niche in ST2(-/-) mice. Thus, the 
      IL-33-ST2 axis controls epithelial niche regeneration by activating a large 
      multi-cellular circuit, including monocyte differentiation into competent 
      repairing AAMs, as well as group-2 innate lymphoid cell (ILC2)-mediated AAM 
      activation.

AB  - Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) airborne pollution increases the risk of chronic 
      respiratory diseases, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), which is 
      characterized by non-specific inflammation of the interstitial lung and extensive 
      deposition of collagen fibers. Type 2 alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2s) are 
      alveolar stem cells in the adult lung that contribute to the lung repair process 
      through complex signaling. Our previous studies demonstrated that OGG1, a kind of 
      DNA repair enzyme, have a critical role in protecting cells from oxidative damage 
      and apoptosis induced by PM2.5, but the contribution of OGG1 in proliferation and 
      self-renewal of AEC2s is not known. Here, we constructed OGG1(-/-)mice to test 
      the effect and mechanism of OGG1 on PM2.5-induced pulmonary fibrosis and injury 
      in vivo. We detected proliferation and self-renewal of OGG1 overexpression or 
      OGG1 knockout AEC2s after PM2.5 injury by flow cytometry and clone formation. We 
      observed that knockout of OGG1 aggravated pulmonary fibrosis, oxidative stress, 
      and AEC2 cell death in PM2.5-injured mice. In addition, OGG1 is required for the 
      proliferation and renewal of AEC2s after PM2.5 injury. Overexpression of OGG1 
      promotes the proliferation and self-renewal of AEC2s by inhibiting PM2.5-mediated 
      oxidative stress and NF-kappaB signaling hyperactivation in vitro. Furthermore, NF-kappaB 
      inhibitors promoted proliferation and self-renewal of OGG1-deficient AEC2s cells 
      after PM2.5 injury, and attenuated PM2.5-induced pulmonary fibrosis and injury in 
      mice. These data establish OGG1 as a regulator of NF-kappaB signal that serves to 
      regulate AEC2 cell proliferation and self-renewal, and suggest a mechanism that 
      inhibition of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway may represent a potential therapeutic 
      strategy for IPF patients with low-expression of OGG1.

TI  - Curcumin Targets p53-Fibrinolytic System in TGF-beta1 Mediated Alveolar Epithelial 
      Mesenchymal Transition in Alveolar Epithelial Cells.

AB  - AIMS: We aim to investigate curcumin interaction with p53-fibrinolytic system, 
      smad dependent and independent pathways underlying their prime role during lung 
      injury and fibrosis. BACKGROUND: Curcumin, an active component of Curcuma longa 
      plant, substantially modulates respiratory conditions. TGF-beta1 plays a central 
      role in lung remodeling by balancing extracellular matrix (ECM) production and 
      degradation, which is a hallmark for alveolar EMT. However, the crosstalk of 
      curcumin is not known yet with TGF- beta1 mediated p53-Fibrinolytic system 
      regulating alveolar EMT leading to IPF. In the present study, the potential 
      molecular mechanism of curcumin in TGF-beta1 mediated p53-fibrinolytic system in 
      basal alveolar epithelial cells was explored. OBJECTIVES: To understand the 
      potential molecular mechanism of curcumin in TGF-beta1 mediated p53-fibrinolytic 
      system in basal alveolar epithelial cells. METHODS: Basal alveolar epithelial 
      cells were treated with TGF- beta1 to induce alveolar EMT and after 24 hrs curcumin 
      was administered to study its anti-fibrotic effects. Molecular techniques like 
      immunoblot, RT-PCR and immunofluorescence were performed to assess the 
      anti-fibrotic role of curcumin on EMT markers, IL-17A, p53-smad interaction to 
      investigate the anti-fibrotic role of curcumin. RESULTS: The results indicated 
      that TGF-beta1-induced EMT in A549 cells exhibited altered expression of the IL-17A, 
      p53-fibrinolytic markers and EMT markers at the mRNA and protein level. 
      Intervention with curcumin attenuated alveolar EMT and inactivated TGF-beta1 induced 
      Smad/non Smad signaling pathways via blocking p53-fibrinolytic system. 
      CONCLUSION: This study provides the first evidence of the dynamic response of 
      curcumin on TGF- beta1 mediated p53-fibrinolytic system during alveolar injury in 
      vitro.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive interstitial lung disease 
      characterized by chronic non-specific inflammation of the interstitial lung and 
      extensive deposition of collagen fibers leading to destruction of lung function. 
      Studies have demonstrated that exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) 
      increases the risk of IPF. In order to recover from PM2.5-induced lung injury, 
      alveolar epithelial cells need to be repaired and regenerated to maintain lung 
      function. Type 2 alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2) are stem cells in the adult 
      lung that contribute to the lung repair process through complex signaling. Our 
      previous studies demonstrated that RAB6, a RAS family member lowly expressed in 
      lung cancer, inhibited lung cancer stem cell self-renewal, but it is unclear 
      whether or not and how RAB6 may regulate AEC2 cell proliferation and self-renewal 
      in PM2.5-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Here, we demonstrated that knockout of RAB6 
      inhibited pulmonary fibrosis, oxidative stress, and AEC2 cell death in 
      PM2.5-injured mice. In addition, knockout of RAB6 decreased Dickkopf 1(DKK1) 
      autocrine and activated proliferation, self-renewal, and wnt/beta-catenin signaling 
      of PM2.5-injured AEC2 cells. RAB6 overexpression increased DKK1 autocrine and 
      inhibited proliferation, self-renewal and wnt/beta-catenin signaling in AEC2 cells 
      in vitro. Furthermore, DKK1 inhibitors promoted proliferation, self-renewal and 
      wnt/beta-catenin signaling of RAB6 overexpressing AEC2 cells, and attenuated 
      PM2.5-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. These data establish RAB6 as a 
      regulator of DKK1 autocrine and wnt/beta-catenin signal that serves to regulate AEC2 
      cell proliferation and self-renewal, and suggest a mechanism that RAB6 disruption 
      may promote AEC2 cell proliferation and self-renewal to enhance lung repair 
      following PM2.5 injury.

TI  - Mechanisms of progressive fibrosis in connective tissue disease (CTD)-associated 
      interstitial lung diseases (ILDs).
PG  - 143-150
LID - 10.1136/annrheumdis-2020-217230 [doi]
AB  - Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), which can arise from a broad spectrum of 
      distinct aetiologies, can manifest as a pulmonary complication of an underlying 
      autoimmune and connective tissue disease (CTD-ILD), such as rheumatoid 
      arthritis-ILD and systemic sclerosis (SSc-ILD). Patients with clinically distinct 
      ILDs, whether CTD-related or not, can exhibit a pattern of common clinical 
      disease behaviour (declining lung function, worsening respiratory symptoms and 
      higher mortality), attributable to progressive fibrosis in the lungs. In recent 
      years, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor nintedanib has demonstrated efficacy and 
      safety in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), SSc-ILD and a broad range of other 
      fibrosing ILDs with a progressive phenotype, including those associated with 
      CTDs. Data from phase II studies also suggest that pirfenidone, which has a 
      different-yet largely unknown-mechanism of action, may also have activity in 
      other fibrosing ILDs with a progressive phenotype, in addition to its known 
      efficacy in IPF. Collectively, these studies add weight to the hypothesis that, 
      irrespective of the original clinical diagnosis of ILD, a progressive fibrosing 
      phenotype may arise from common, underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of 
      fibrosis involving pathways associated with the targets of nintedanib and, 
      potentially, pirfenidone. However, despite the early proof of concept provided by 
      these clinical studies, very little is known about the mechanistic commonalities 
      and differences between ILDs with a progressive phenotype. In this review, we 
      explore the biological and genetic mechanisms that drive fibrosis, and identify 
      the missing evidence needed to provide the rationale for further studies that use 
      the progressive phenotype as a target population.

AB  - Respiratory diseases are one of the prime topics of concern in the current era 
      due to improper diagnostics tools. Gene-editing therapy, like Clustered regularly 
      interspaced palindromic repeats- associated nuclease 9 (CRISPR/Cas9), is gaining 
      popularity in pulmonary research, opening up doors to invaluable insights on 
      underlying mechanisms. CRISPR/Cas9 can be considered as a potential gene-editing 
      tool with a scientific community that is helping in the advancement of knowledge 
      in respiratory health and therapy. As an appealing therapeutic tool, we hereby 
      explore the advanced research on the application of CRISPR/Cas9 tools in chronic 
      respiratory diseases such as lung cancer, Acute respiratory distress syndrome 
      (ARDS) and cystic fibrosis (CF). We also address the urgent need to establish 
      this gene-editing tool in various other lung diseases such as asthma, Chronic 
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The 
      present review introduces CRISPR/Cas9 as a worthy application in targeting 
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition and fibrinolytic system via editing specific 
      genes. Thereby, based on the efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9, it can be considered as a 
      promising therapeutic tool in respiratory health research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is associated with an increased 
      risk for lung cancer, but the underlying mechanisms driving malignant 
      transformation remain largely unknown. This study aimed to identify 
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs) distinguishing IPF and lung cancer from 
      healthy individuals and common genes driving the transformation from healthy to 
      IPF and lung cancer. METHODS: The gene expression data for IPF and non-small cell 
      lung cancer (NSCLC) were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) 
      database. The DEG signatures were identified via unsupervised two-way clustering 
      (TWC) analysis, supervised support vector machine analysis, dimensional 
      reduction, and mutual exclusivity analysis. Gene enrichment and pathway analyses 
      were performed to identify common signaling pathways. The most significant 
      signature genes in common among IPF and lung cancer were further verified by 
      immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The gene expression data from GSE24206 and 
      GSE18842 were merged into a super array dataset comprising 86 patients with lung 
      disorders (17 IPF and 46 NSCLC) and 51 healthy controls and measuring 23,494 
      unique genes. Seventy-nine signature DEGs were found among IPF and NSCLC. The 
      peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway was the most 
      enriched pathway associated with lung disorders, and matrix metalloproteinase-1 
      (MMP-1) in this pathway was mutually exclusive with several genes in IPF and 
      NSCLC. Subsequent immunohistochemical analysis verified enhanced MMP1 expression 
      in NSCLC associated with IPF. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, we defined common 
      signature genes for IPF and NSCLC. The mutually exclusive sets of genes were 
      potential drivers for IPF and NSCLC.

      Pulmonary Fibrosis.
PG  - 458-470
LID - 10.1164/rccm.201910-1977OC [doi]
AB  - Rationale: Aberrant lung remodeling in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is 
      characterized by elevated MMP9 (matrix metalloproteinase 9) expression, but the 
      precise role of this matrix metalloproteinase in this disease has yet to be fully 
      elucidated.Objectives: To evaluate antifibrotic effects of MMP9 inhibition on 
      IPF.Methods: Quantitative genomic, proteomic, and functional analyses both in 
      vitro and in vivo were used to determine MMP9 expression in IPF cells and the 
      effects of MMP9 inhibition on profibrotic mechanisms.Measurements and Main 
      Results: In the present study, we demonstrate that MMP9 expression was increased 
      in airway basal cell (ABC)-like cells from IPF lungs compared with ABC cells from 
      normal lungs. The inhibition of MMP9 activity with an anti-MMP9 antibody, 
      andecaliximab, blocked TGF-beta1 (transforming growth factor beta1)-induced Smad2 
      phosphorylation. However, in a subset of cells from patients with IPF, TGF-beta1 
      activation in their ABC-like cells was unaffected or enhanced by MMP9 blockade 
      (i.e., nonresponders). Further analysis of nonresponder ABC-like cells treated 
      with andecaliximab revealed an association with type 1 IFN expression, and the 
      addition of IFNalpha to these cells modulated both MMP9 expression and TGF-beta1 
      activation. Finally, the inhibition of MMP9 ameliorated pulmonary fibrosis 
      induced by responder lung cells but not a nonresponder in a humanized 
      immunodeficient mouse model of IPF.Conclusions: Together, these data demonstrate 
      that MMP9 regulates the activation of ABC-like cells in IPF and that targeting 
      this MMP might be beneficial to a subset of patients with IPF who show sufficient 
      expression of type 1 IFNs.

PG  - 43-58
LID - 10.1039/d0mo00108b [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a debilitating chronic progressive and 
      fibrosing lung disease that culminates in the destruction of alveolar integrity 
      and dismal prognosis. Its etiology is unknown and pathophysiology remains 
      unclear. While great advances have been made in elucidating the pathogenesis 
      mechanism, considerable gaps related to information on pathogenetic pathways and 
      key protein targets involved in the clinical course of the disease exist. These 
      issues need to be addressed for better clinical management of this highly 
      challenging disease. Omics approach has revolutionized the entire area of disease 
      understanding and holds promise in its translation to clinical biomarker 
      discovery. This review outlines the contribution of proteomics towards 
      identification of important biomarkers in IPF in terms of their clinical utility, 
      i.e. prognosis, differential diagnosis, disease progression and treatment 
      monitoring. The major dysregulated pathways associated with IPF are also 
      discussed. Based on numerous proteomics studies on human and animal models, it is 
      proposed that IPF pathogenesis involves complex interactions of several pathways 
      such as oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, unfolded protein 
      response, coagulation system, inflammation, abnormal wounding, fibroblast 
      proliferation, fibrogenesis and deposition of extracellular matrix. These 
      pathways and their key path-changing mediators need further validation in large 
      well-planned multi-centric trials at various geographical locations for 
      successful development of clinical biomarkers of this confounding disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key process in the onset 
      and development of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) with unclear mechanisms. 
      Our previous studies found that bleomycin and tunicamycin could induce ER stress 
      and consequently trigger EMT accompanying with IL-32 overexpression. This study 
      was aimed to investigate the effects of IL-32 on EMT and ER stress to elucidate 
      the pathogenesis of IPF. METHODS: Human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells were 
      treated with recombinant human (rh)IL-32, IL-32 siRNA and EMT inducer 
      tunicamycin, or 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA), respectively. Then the cell 
      morphology was observed and the expression of ER-related markers and EMT-related 
      markers were detected by RT-qPCR or western blotting. RESULTS: Stimulation of 
      A549 cells with rhIL-32 led to a morphological change from a pebble-like shape to 
      an elongated shape in a portion of the cells, accompanied by down regulated 
      expression of the epithelial cell marker E-cadherin and up regulated expression 
      of the mesenchymal cell markers N-cadherin, Vimentin, and Zeb-1. However, these 
      rhIL-32 induced changes were inhibited by the ER stress inhibitor 4-PBA. 
      Suppression of IL-32 expression with siRNA inhibited TM-induced EMT. Further 
      stimulation of the A549 cells with rhIL-32 demonstrated an increase in the 
      expression of GRP78, although this increase was also inhibited by 4-PBA. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that IL-32 induces EMT in A549 cells by 
      triggering ER stress, and IL-32 may be a novel marker for IPF.

TI  - Itaconate controls the severity of pulmonary fibrosis.
LID - 10.1126/sciimmunol.abc1884 [doi]
LID - eabc1884
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal lung disease in which airway 
      macrophages (AMs) play a key role. Itaconate has emerged as a mediator of 
      macrophage function, but its role during fibrosis is unknown. Here, we reveal 
      that itaconate is an endogenous antifibrotic factor in the lung. Itaconate levels 
      are reduced in bronchoalveolar lavage, and itaconate-synthesizing cis-aconitate 
      decarboxylase expression (ACOD1) is reduced in AMs from patients with IPF 
      compared with controls. In the murine bleomycin model of pulmonary fibrosis, 
      Acod1(-/-) mice develop persistent fibrosis, unlike wild-type (WT) littermates. 
      Profibrotic gene expression is increased in Acod1(-/-) tissue-resident AMs 
      compared with WT, and adoptive transfer of WT monocyte-recruited AMs rescued mice 
      from disease phenotype. Culture of lung fibroblasts with itaconate decreased 
      proliferation and wound healing capacity, and inhaled itaconate was protective in 
      mice in vivo. Collectively, these data identify itaconate as critical for 
      controlling the severity of lung fibrosis, and targeting this pathway may be a 
      viable therapeutic strategy.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and irreversible disease 
      characterized by an increase in differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts 
      and excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix in lung tissue. 
      Pharmacological activation of NRF2 has proved to be a valuable antifibrotic 
      approach, however the detailed mechanisms of how NRF2 mediates antifibrotic 
      function remain unclear. In this study, we found that the antifibrotic function 
      of sulforaphane (SFN), an NRF2 activator, was largely dependent on LOC344887, a 
      long noncoding RNA. Two functional AREs were identified in both the promoter and 
      intron 1 of LOC344887, which defines LOC344887 as a novel anti-fibrotic NRF2 
      target gene. RNA-seq analysis revealed that LOC344887 controls genes and 
      signaling pathways associated with fibrogenesis. Deletion or downregulation of 
      LOC344887 enhanced expression of CDH2/N-cadherin, as well as a number of other 
      fibrotic genes and blunted the antifibrotic effects of SFN. Furthermore, 
      LOC344887-mediated downregulation of fibrotic genes may involve the PI3K-AKT 
      signaling pathway, as pharmacologic inhibition of PI3K activity blocked the 
      effects of LOC344887 knockdown. Our findings demonstrate that NRF2-mediated 
      LOC344887 upregulation contributes to the antifibrotic potential of SFN by 
      repressing the expression of CDH2 and other fibrotic genes, providing novel 
      insight into how NRF2 controls the regulatory networks of IPF. This study 
      provides a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of NRF2 activators 
      against pulmonary fibrosis and presents a novel therapeutic axis for prevention 
      and intervention of fibrosis-related diseases.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, life-threatening lung 
      disease with a poor prognosis. N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (Ac-SDKP) is 
      a critical negative regulator of fibrosis development. However, it's extremely 
      short half-life greatly limits its applications. Previously, we reported an 
      Ac-SDKP analog peptide in which Asp and Lys residues were replaced with D-amino 
      acids (Ac-SD(D) K(D) P). Ac-SD(D) K(D) P exhibits better resistance to 
      angiotensin-1-converting enzyme (ACE)-mediated degradation and a longer half-life 
      than Ac-SDKP in rat and human sera. The objective of this study was to explore 
      the potential application of Ac-SD(D) K(D) P for the treatment of IPF and to 
      clarify the underlying mechanisms. We found that Ac-SD(D) K(D) P exerted similar 
      antifibrotic effects as Ac-SDKP on human fetal lung fibroblast-1 (HFL-1) 
      proliferation, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), collagen I and collagen III 
      expression, and Smad-2 phosphorylation in vitro. In vivo, Ac-SD(D) K(D) P 
      exhibited significantly greater protective effects against bleomycin-induced 
      pulmonary fibrosis than Ac-SDKP in mice. alpha-SMA, CD45, collagen I and collagen III 
      expression, and Smad-2 phosphorylation were significantly decreased in the lungs 
      of Ac-SD(D) K(D) P-treated but not Ac-SDKP-treated mice. Furthermore, a pull-down 
      experiment was used to screen for molecules that interact with Ac-SDKP. 
      Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and computer-based molecular docking experiments 
      demonstrated an interaction between Ac-SDKP or Ac-SD(D) K(D) P (Ac-SDKP/Ac-SD(D) 
      K(D) P) and serine/arginine-rich protein-specific kinase 1 (SRPK1) that caused 
      inhibition SRPK1-mediated phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/ serine/threonine kinase 
      (PIK3/AKT) signaling pathway activation and Smad2 phosphorylation and thereby 
      attenuated lung fibrosis. Our data suggest that long-acting Ac-SD(D) K(D) P may 
      potentially be an effective drug for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis. The 
      interacting molecule and antifibrotic mechanism of Ac-SDKP/Ac-SD(D) K(D) P were 
      also identified, providing an experimental and theoretical foundation for the 
      clinical application of the drug.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive disease 
      with a high morbidity and mortality. Some of the mechanisms of fibrosis 
      development have been described using rodent models; however, the relevance of 
      findings in these animal models is difficult to assess. New innovative models are 
      needed that closely mimic IPF disease pathology. METHODS: To overcome this unmet 
      need of investigating IPF with a relevant model, we utilized tree shrews, which 
      are genetically, anatomically, and metabolically similar to primates and humans. 
      Using human antibodies and primers, we investigated the role of macrophage 
      phenotypic switching in normal and IPF subjects and bleomycin-injured tree 
      shrews. RESULTS: Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells from tree shrews expressed 
      human markers, and there was recruitment of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) 
      to the lung in IPF subjects and bleomycin-injured tree shrews. MDMs were 
      polarized to a profibrotic phenotype in IPF and in bleomycin-injured tree shrews. 
      Resident alveolar macrophages (RAMs) expressed proinflammatory markers regardless 
      of bleomycin exposure. Tree shrews developed bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis 
      with architectural distortion in parenchyma and widespread collagen deposition. 
      CONCLUSION: The profibrotic polarization of macrophages has been demonstrated to 
      be present in IPF subjects and in fibrotic mice. Although the lung macrophages 
      have long been considered to be homogeneous, recent evidence indicates that these 
      cells are heterogeneous during multiple chronic lung diseases. Here, we show new 
      data that indicate a critical and essential role for macrophage-fibroblast 
      crosstalk promoting fibroblast differentiation and collagen production. in the 
      development and progression of fibrosis. The current data strongly suggest 
      development of therapeutics that attenuate of the profibrotic activation of MDMs 
      may mitigate macrophage-fibroblast interaction. These observations demonstrate 
      that tree shrews are an ideal animal model to investigate the pathogenesis of IPF 
      as they are genetically, anatomically, and metabolically closer to humans than 
      the more commonly used rodent models.

TI  - IL-24 deficiency protects mice against bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis by 
      repressing IL-4-induced M2 program in macrophages.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most common type of idiopathic 
      interstitial pneumonia and has one of the poorest prognosis. However, the 
      molecular mechanisms underlying IPF progression remain largely unknown. In this 
      study, we determined that IL-24, an IL-20 subfamily cytokine member, was 
      increased both in the serum of IPF patients and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 
      (BALF) of mice following bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis. As a result, 
      IL-24 deficiency protected mice from BLM-induced lung injury and fibrosis. 
      Specifically, loss of IL-24 significantly attenuated transforming growth factor 
      beta1 (TGF-beta1) production and reduced M2 macrophage infiltration in the lung of 
      BLM-induced mice. Mechanistically, IL-24 alone did not show a perceptible impact 
      on the induction of M2 macrophages, but it synergized with IL-4 to promote M2 
      program in macrophages. IL-24 suppressed IL-4-induced expression of suppressor of 
      cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) and SOCS3, through which it enhanced signal 
      transducer and activator of transcription 6/peroxisome proliferator-activated 
      receptor gamma (STAT6/PPARgamma) signaling, thereby promoting IL-4-induced production 
      of M2 macrophages. Collectively, our data support that IL-24 synergizes with IL-4 
      to promote macrophage M2 program contributing to the development of pulmonary 
      fibrosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There are two US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs, 
      pirfenidone and nintedanib, for treatment of patients with idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF). However, neither of these drugs provide a cure. In addition, both 
      are associated with several drug-related adverse events. Hence, the pursuit for 
      newer IPF therapeutics continues. Recent studies show that joint analysis of 
      systems-biology-level information with drug-disease connectivity are effective in 
      discovery of biologically relevant candidate therapeutics. METHODS: Publicly 
      available gene expression signatures from patients with IPF were used to query a 
      large-scale perturbagen signature library to discover compounds that can 
      potentially reverse dysregulated gene expression in IPF. Two methods were used to 
      calculate IPF-compound connectivity: gene expression-based connectivity and 
      feature-based connectivity. Identified compounds were further prioritized if 
      their shared mechanism(s) of action were IPF-related. RESULTS: We found 77 
      compounds as potential candidate therapeutics for IPF. Of these, 39 compounds are 
      either FDA-approved for other diseases or are currently in phase II/III clinical 
      trials suggesting their repurposing potential for IPF. Among these compounds are 
      multiple receptor kinase inhibitors (e.g. nintedanib, currently approved for IPF, 
      and sunitinib), aurora kinase inhibitor (barasertib), epidermal growth factor 
      receptor inhibitors (erlotinib, gefitinib), calcium channel blocker (verapamil), 
      phosphodiesterase inhibitors (roflumilast, sildenafil), PPAR agonists 
      (pioglitazone), histone deacetylase inhibitors (entinostat), and opioid receptor 
      antagonists (nalbuphine). As a proof of concept, we performed in vitro 
      validations with verapamil using lung fibroblasts from IPF and show its potential 
      benefits in pulmonary fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: As about half of the candidates 
      discovered in this study are either FDA-approved or are currently in clinical 
      trials for other diseases, rapid translation of these compounds as potential IPF 
      therapeutics is possible. Further, the integrative connectivity analysis 
      framework in this study can be adapted in early phase drug discovery for other 
      common and rare diseases with transcriptomic profiles.The reviews of this paper

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is featured with inflammation and extensive 
      lung remodeling caused by overloaded deposition of extracellular matrix. 
      Scutellarin is the major effective ingredient of breviscapine and its 
      anti-inflammation efficacy has been reported before. Nevertheless, the impact of 
      scutellarin on IPF and the downstream molecular mechanism remain unclear. In this 
      study, scutellarin suppressed BLM-induced inflammation via NF-kappaB/NLRP3 pathway 
      both in vivo and in vitro. BLM significantly elevated p-p65/p65 ratio, IkappaBalpha 
      degradation, and levels of NLRP3, caspase-1, caspase-11, ASC, GSDMD(Nterm), 
      IL-1beta, and IL-18, while scutellarin reversed the above alterations except for 
      that of caspase-11. Scutellarin inhibited BLM-induced epithelial-mesenchymal 
      transition (EMT) process in vivo and in vitro. The expression levels of 
      EMT-related markers, including fibronectin, vimentin, N-cadherin, matrix 
      metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9, were increased in BLM group, and 
      suppressed by scutellarin. The expression level of E-cadherin showed the opposite 
      changes. However, overexpression of NLRP3 eliminated the anti-inflammation and 
      anti-EMT functions of scutellarin in vitro. In conclusion, scutellarin suppressed 
      inflammation and EMT in BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis through NF-kappaB/NLRP3 
      signaling.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal lung disease 
      accounting for 1% of UK deaths. In the familial form of pulmonary fibrosis, 
      causal genes have been identified in about 30% of cases, and a majority of these 
      causal genes are associated with telomere maintenance. Prematurely shortened 
      leukocyte telomere length is associated with IPF and chronic obstructive 
      pulmonary disease (COPD), a disease with similar demographics and shared risk 
      factors. Using mendelian randomisation, we investigated evidence supporting a 
      causal role for short telomeres in IPF and COPD. METHODS: Mendelian randomisation 
      inference of telomere length causality was done for IPF (up to 1369 cases) and 
      COPD (13 538 cases) against 435 866 controls of European ancestry in UK Biobank. 
      Polygenic risk scores were calculated and two-sample mendelian randomisation 
      analyses were done using seven genetic variants previously associated with 
      telomere length, with replication analysis in an IPF cohort (2668 cases vs 8591 
      controls) and COPD cohort (15 256 cases vs 47 936 controls). FINDINGS: In the UK 
      Biobank, a genetically instrumented one-SD shorter telomere length was associated 
      with higher odds of IPF (odds ratio [OR] 4.19, 95% CI 2.33-7.55; p=0.0031) but 
      not COPD (1.07, 0.88-1.30; p=0.51). Similarly, an association was found in the 
      IPF replication cohort (12.3, 5.05-30.1; p=0.0015) and not in the COPD 
      replication cohort (1.04, 0.71-1.53; p=0.83). Meta-analysis of the two-sample 
      mendelian randomisation results provided evidence inferring that shorter 
      telomeres cause IPF (5.81 higher odds of IPF, 95% CI 3.56-9.50; 
      p=2.19 x 10(-12)). There was no evidence to infer that telomere length caused 
      COPD (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.90-1.27; p=0.46). INTERPRETATION: Cellular senescence is 
      hypothesised as a major driving force in IPF and COPD; telomere shortening might 
      be a contributory factor in IPF, suggesting divergent mechanisms in COPD. 
      Defining a key role for telomere shortening enables greater focus in 
      telomere-related diagnostics, treatments, and the search for a cure in IPF. 
      Investigation of therapies that improve telomere length is warranted. FUNDING:

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), the most common form of idiopathic 
      interstitial pneumonia, is a progressive, irreversible, and typically lethal 
      disease characterized by an abnormal fibrotic response involving vast areas of 
      the lungs. Given the poor knowledge of the mechanisms underpinning IPF onset and 
      progression, a better understanding of the cellular processes and molecular 
      pathways involved is essential for the development of effective therapies, 
      currently lacking. Besides a number of established IPF-associated risk factors, 
      such as cigarette smoking, environmental factors, comorbidities, and viral 
      infections, several other processes have been linked with this devastating 
      disease. Apoptosis, senescence, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, 
      endothelial-mesenchymal transition, and epithelial cell migration have been shown 
      to play a key role in IPF-associated tissue remodeling. Moreover, molecules, such 
      as chemokines, cytokines, growth factors, adenosine, glycosaminoglycans, 
      non-coding RNAs, and cellular processes including oxidative stress, mitochondrial 
      dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum stress, hypoxia, and alternative 
      polyadenylation have been linked with IPF development. Importantly, strategies 
      targeting these processes have been investigated to modulate abnormal cellular 
      phenotypes and maintain tissue homeostasis in the lung. This review provides an 
      update regarding the emerging cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the 
      onset and progression of IPF.

TI  - The Potential Effects of Curcumin on Pulmonary Fibroblasts of Idiopathic 
      Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)-Approaching with Next-Generation Sequencing and 
      Bioinformatics.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive interstitial 
      lung disease. Currently, therapeutic options are limited for this fatal disease. 
      Curcumin, with its pleiotropic effects, has been studied for its potential 
      therapeutic utilities in various diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis. However, 
      the detailed mechanisms have not been studied comprehensively. We conducted a 
      next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics study to investigate changes in the 
      profiles of mRNA and microRNA after curcumin treatment in IPF fibroblasts. We 
      identified 23 downregulated and 8 upregulated protein-coding genes in 
      curcumin-treated IPF fibroblasts. Using STRING and IPA, we identified that 
      suppression of cell cycle progression was the main cellular function associated 
      with these differentially expressed genes. We also identified 13 downregulated 
      and 57 upregulated microRNAs in curcumin-treated IPF fibroblasts. Further 
      analysis identified a potential microRNA-mediated gene expression alteration in 
      curcumin-treated IPF fibroblasts, namely, downregulated hsa-miR-6724-5p and 
      upregulated KLF10. Therefore, curcumin might decrease the level of 
      hsa-miR-6724-5p, leading to increased KLF10 expression, resulting in cell cycle 
      arrest in curcumin-treated IPF fibroblasts. In conclusion, our findings might 
      support the potential role of curcumin in the treatment of IPF, but further 
      in-depth study is warranted to confirm our findings.

TI  - In silico immune infiltration profiling combined with functional enrichment 
      analysis reveals a potential role for naive B cells as a trigger for severe 
      immune responses in the lungs of COVID-19 patients.
PG  - e0242900

LID - e0242900
AB  - COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has rapidly spread to more than 160 countries 
      worldwide since 2020. Despite tremendous efforts and resources spent worldwide 
      trying to explore antiviral drugs, there is still no effective clinical treatment 
      for COVID-19 to date. Approximately 15% of COVID-19 cases progress to pneumonia, 
      and patients with severe pneumonia may die from acute respiratory distress 
      syndrome (ARDS). It is believed that pulmonary fibrosis from SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      further leads to ARDS, often resulting in irreversible impairment of lung 
      function. If the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 infection primarily causes an 
      immune response or immune cell infiltration can be identified, it may be possible 
      to mitigate excessive immune responses by modulating the infiltration and 
      activation of specific targets, thereby reducing or preventing severe lung 
      damage. However, the extent to which immune cell subsets are significantly 
      altered in the lung tissues of COVID-19 patients remains to be elucidated. This 
      study applied the CIBERSORT-X method to comprehensively evaluate the 
      transcriptional estimated immune infiltration landscape in the lung tissues of 
      COVID-19 patients and further compare it with the lung tissues of patients with 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We found a variety of immune cell subtypes 
      in the COVID-19 group, especially naive B cells were highly infiltrated. 
      Comparison of functional transcriptomic analyses revealed that non-differentiated 
      naive B cells may be the main cause of the over-active humoral immune response. 
      Using several publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing data to validate the 
      genetic differences in B-cell populations, it was found that the B-cells 
      collected from COVID-19 patients were inclined towards naive B-cells, whereas 
      those collected from IPF patients were inclined towards memory B-cells. Further 
      differentiation of B cells between COVID-19 mild and severe patients showed that 
      B cells from severe patients tended to be antibody-secreting cells, and gene 
      expression showed that B cells from severe patients were similar to DN2 B cells 
      that trigger extrafollicular response. Moreover, a higher percentage of B-cell 
      infiltration seems associated with poorer clinical outcome. Finally, a comparison 
      of several specific COVID-19 cases treated with targeted B-cell therapy suggests 
      that appropriate suppression of naive B cells might potentially be a novel 
      strategy to alleviate the severe symptoms of COVID-19.

TI  - Loss of Fas signaling in fibroblasts impairs homeostatic fibrosis resolution and 
      promotes persistent pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, irreversible fibrotic 
      disease of the distal lung alveoli that culminates in respiratory failure and 
      reduced lifespan. Unlike normal lung repair in response to injury, IPF is 
      associated with the accumulation and persistence of fibroblasts and 
      myofibroblasts, as well as continued production of collagen and other 
      extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Prior in vitro studies have led to the 
      hypothesis that the development of resistance to Fas-induced apoptosis by lung 
      fibroblasts and myofibroblasts contributes to their accumulation in the distal 
      lung tissues of IPF patients. Here, we test this hypothesis in vivo in the 
      resolving model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Using genetic 
      loss-of-function approaches to inhibit Fas signaling in fibroblasts, potentially 
      novel flow cytometry strategies to quantify lung fibroblast subsets, and 
      transcriptional profiling of lung fibroblasts by bulk and single cell RNA 
      sequencing, we show that Fas is necessary for lung fibroblast apoptosis during 
      homeostatic resolution of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in vivo. 
      Furthermore, we show that loss of Fas signaling leads to the persistence and 
      continued profibrotic functions of lung fibroblasts. Our studies provide insights 
      into the mechanisms that contribute to fibroblast survival, persistence, and 
      continued ECM deposition in the context of IPF and how failure to undergo 
      Fas-induced apoptosis impairs fibrosis resolution.

AB  - AIMS: This study aims to identify the biomarkers for chronic hypersensitivity 
      pneumonitis (CHP) and facilitate the precise gene therapy of CHP. BACKGROUND: 
      Chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (CHP) is an interstitial lung disease caused 
      by hypersensitive reactions to inhaled antigens. Clinically, the task of 
      differentiating CHP and other interstitial lung diseases, especially idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), was challenging. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we analyzed 
      the publically available gene expression profile of 82 CHP patients, 103 IPF 
      patients, and 103 control samples to identify the CHP biomarkers. METHODS: The 
      CHP biomarkers were selected with advanced feature selection methods: Monte Carlo 
      Feature Selection (MCFS) and Incremental Feature Selection (IFS). A Support 
      Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was built. Then, we analyzed these CHP biomarkers 
      through functional enrichment analysis and differential co-expression analysis. 
      RESULTS: There were 674 identified CHP biomarkers. The co-expression network of 
      these biomarkers in CHP included more negative regulations and the network 
      structure of CHP was quite different from the network of IPF and control. 
      CONCLUSION: The SVM classifier may serve as an important clinical tool to address 
      the challenging task of differentiating between CHP and IPF. Many of the 
      biomarker genes on the differential coexpression network showed great promise in 
      revealing the underlying mechanisms of CHP.

TI  - Endothelial Progenitor Cells as a Potential Biomarker in Interstitial Lung 
      Disease Associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis.
LID - 10.3390/jcm9124098 [doi]
LID - 4098
AB  - Interstitial lung disease (ILD) increases morbidity and mortality in patients 
      with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although the pathogenesis of ILD associated with 
      RA (RA-ILD(+)) remains poorly defined, vascular tissue is crucial in lung 
      physiology. In this context, endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) are involved in 
      endothelial tissue repair. However, little is known about their implication in 
      RA-ILD(+). Accordingly, we aimed to investigate the potential role of EPC related 
      to endothelial damage in RA-ILD(+). EPC quantification in peripheral blood from 
      80 individuals (20 RA-ILD(+) patients, 25 RA-ILD(-) patients, 21 idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients, and 14 healthy controls) was performed by flow 
      cytometry. EPC were considered as CD34(+), CD45(low), CD309(+) and CD133(+). A 
      significant increase in EPC frequency in RA-ILD(+) patients, as well as in 
      RA-ILD(-) and IPF patients, was found when compared with controls (p < 0.001, p = 
      0.02 and p < 0.001, respectively). RA-ILD(+) patients exhibited a higher EPC 
      frequency than the RA-ILD(-) ones (p = 0.003), but lower than IPF patients (p < 
      0.001). Our results suggest that EPC increase may represent a reparative 
      compensatory mechanism in patients with RA-ILD(+). The degree of EPC frequency 
      may help to identify the presence of ILD in RA patients and to discriminate 
      RA-ILD(+) from IPF.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive disease of unknown 
      cause characterized by relentless scarring of the lung parenchyma leading to 
      reduced quality of life and earlier mortality. IPF is an age-related disorder, 
      and with the population aging worldwide, the economic burden of IPF is expected 
      to steadily increase in the future. The mechanisms of fibrosis in IPF remain 
      elusive, with favored concepts of disease pathogenesis involving recurrent 
      microinjuries to a genetically predisposed alveolar epithelium, followed by an 
      aberrant reparative response characterized by excessive collagen deposition. 
      Pirfenidone and nintedanib are approved for treatment of IPF based on their 
      ability to slow functional decline and disease progression; however, they do not 
      offer a cure and are associated with tolerability issues. In this review, we 
      critically discuss how cutting-edge research in disease pathogenesis may 
      translate into identification of new therapeutic targets, thus facilitate drug 
      discovery. There is a growing portfolio of treatment options for IPF. However, 
      targeting the multitude of profibrotic cytokines and growth factors involved in 
      disease pathogenesis may require a combination of therapeutic strategies with 
      different mechanisms of action.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a type of scarring lung disease 
      characterized by a chronic, progressive, and irreversible decline in lung 
      function. The genetic basis of IPF remains elusive. A transcriptome-wide 
      association study (TWAS) of IPF was performed by FUSION using gene expression 
      weights of three tissues combined with a large-scale genome-wide association 
      study (GWAS) dataset, totally involving 2,668 IPF cases and 8,591 controls. 
      Significant genes identified by TWAS were then subjected to gene ontology (GO) 
      and pathway enrichment analysis. The overlapped GO terms and pathways between 
      enrichment analysis of TWAS significant genes and differentially expressed genes 
      (DEGs) from the genome-wide mRNA expression profiling of IPF were also 
      identified. For TWAS significant genes, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network 
      and clustering modules analyses were further conducted using STRING and 
      Cytoscape. Overall, TWAS identified a group of candidate genes for IPF under the 
      Bonferroni corrected P value threshold (0.05/14929 = 3.35 x 10(-6)), such as DSP 
      (P (TWAS) = 1.35 x 10(-29) for lung tissue), MUC5B (P (TWAS) = 1.09 x 10(-28) for 
      lung tissue), and TOLLIP (P (TWAS) = 1.41 x 10(-15) for whole blood). Pathway 
      enrichment analysis identified multiple candidate pathways, such as herpes 
      simplex infection (P value = 7.93 x 10(-5)) and antigen processing and 
      presentation (P value = 6.55 x 10(-5)). 38 common GO terms and 8 KEGG pathways 
      shared by enrichment analysis of TWAS significant genes and DEGs were identified. 
      In the PPI network, 14 genes (DYNLL1, DYNC1LI1, DYNLL2, HLA-DRB5, HLA-DPB1, 
      HLA-DQB2, HLA-DQA2, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB1, POLR2L, CENPP, CENPK, NUP133, and NUP107) 
      were simultaneously detected by hub gene and module analysis. In conclusion, 
      through integrative analysis of TWAS and mRNA expression profiles, we identified 
      multiple novel candidate genes, GO terms and pathways for IPF, which contributes 
      to the understanding of the genetic mechanism of IPF.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Peel of Citrus reticulata, a Chinese herbal drug 
      with functions of regulating Qi and expelling phlegm, has been used for the 
      treatment of lung related diseases in Chinese medicine for a long time. Its 
      detailed effects on collagen in anti-idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is still 
      unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: To explore the effects of citrus alkaline extract 
      (CAE) on collagen synthesis, crosslinking and deposition in pulmonary fibrosis 
      and understand the possible signal pathways involved in the activity. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: CAE was prepared from C. reticulata. Bleomycin-induced pulmonary 
      fibrosis mouse model was applied. Pulmonary fibrosis of lung was estimated with 
      histopathology analysis, and collagen deposition was evaluated with 
      immunohistochemistry. Collagen crosslinking related biomarkers and enzymes were 
      analyzed with chemical methods, immunohistochemical and western blot analyses. 
      RESULTS: CAE oral administration lowered hydroxyproline content, inhibited the 
      collagen deposition including expressions of collagen I and III, and relieved 
      bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice model. The productions of a collagen 
      crosslink pyridinoline and crosslinking related enzymes including lysyl oxidase 
      (LOX), lysyl oxidase-like protein 1 (LOXL1) in lung were suppressed by CAE 
      treatment. Furthermore, the protein expressions of TGF-beta1 and Smad3 levels in 
      lungs were also downregulated by CAE. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that 
      CAE inhibited collagen synthesis, crosslinking and deposition, and ameliorated 
      bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Preliminary mechanism study revealed that 
      CAE exerted its bioactivity at least via downregulation of TGF-beta1/Smad3 pathway. 
      Our findings provided a great potential in fighting IPF based on CAE.

TI  - MiR-608 overexpression in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).
PG  - 1
LID - 10.1186/s12890-020-01377-3 [doi]
LID - 1
AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive disease 
      that causes scarring of the lungs. The disease is associated with the usual 
      interstitial pneumonia pattern, which was not yet fully recapitulated by an 
      animal model. Therefore, the disease is considered 'human specific'. miRNA-608 is 
      a primate specific miRNA with many potential targets, such CdC42 and Interlukin-6 
      (IL-6) that were previously implicated in IPF pathology. OBJECTIVE: To test 
      miR-608 expression and its targets in IPF patient samples. METHODS: RNA was 
      extracted from Formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections (N = 18). 
      miRNA-608 and Cdc42 and IL-6 levels were analyzed by qPCR. Acetylcholinesterase 
      (AChE) is another target of miRNA-608. Its' rs17228616 allele has a 
      single-nucleotide polymorphism causing weakened miR-608 interaction (C2098A). 
      Thus, DNA was extracted from whole blood samples from 56 subjects with fibrosing 
      interstitial lung disease and this region was sequenced for assessment of 
      rs17228616 allele polymorphism. RESULTS: miR-608 is significantly overexpressed 
      in IPF samples in comparison with controls (p < 0.05). Cdc42 and IL-6 levels were 
      lower in the IPF patient samples compared with control samples (p < 0.001 and 
      p < 0.05, respectively). The frequency of the rs17228616 minor A-allele was 17/56 
      (30.4%) with all patients being heterozygous. This result is significant vs. the 
      published Israeli cohort of healthy individuals, which reported 17% prevalence of 
      this allele in healthy control volunteers (p = 0.01, OR = 2.1, CI 95% 
      [1.19-3.9]). CONCLUSION: miR-608 is overexpressed in IPF patients. While the 
      exact mechanism remains to be discovered, it could potentially promote fibrotic 
      disease.

TI  - MAP3K8 Regulates Cox-2-Mediated Prostaglandin E(2) Production in the Lung and 
      Suppresses Pulmonary Inflammation and Fibrosis.
PG  - 607-620
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.2000862 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by exuberant deposition of 
      extracellular matrix components, leading to the deterioration of lung 
      architecture and respiratory functions. Profibrotic mechanisms are controlled by 
      multiple regulatory molecules, including MAPKs, in turn regulated by multiple 
      phosphorylation cascades. MAP3K8 is an MAPK kinase kinase suggested to 
      pleiotropically regulate multiple pathogenic pathways in the context of 
      inflammation and cancer; however, a possible role in the pathogenesis of IPF has 
      not been investigated. In this report, MAP3K8 mRNA levels were found decreased in 
      the lungs of IPF patients and of mice upon bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. 
      Ubiquitous genetic deletion of Map3k8 in mice exacerbated the modeled disease, 
      whereas bone marrow transfer experiments indicated that although MAP3K8 
      regulatory functions are active in both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells, 
      Map3k8 in hematopoietic cells has a more dominant role. Macrophage-specific 
      deletion of Map3k8 was further found to be sufficient for disease exacerbation 
      thus confirming a major role for macrophages in pulmonary fibrotic responses and 
      suggesting a main role for Map3k8 in the homeostasis of their effector functions 
      in the lung. Map3k8 deficiency was further shown to be associated with decreased 
      Cox-2 expression, followed by a decrease in PGE(2) production in the lung; 
      accordingly, exogenous administration of PGE(2) reduced inflammation and reversed 
      the exacerbated fibrotic profile of Map3k8 (-/-) mice. Therefore, MAP3K8 has a 
      central role in the regulation of inflammatory responses and Cox-2-mediated 
      PGE(2) production in the lung, and the attenuation of its expression is integral 
      to pulmonary fibrosis development.

AB  - This study investigates the effects of a site-directed TG2-selective inhibitor on 
      the lung myofibroblast phenotype and ECM deposition to elucidate TG2 as a novel 
      therapeutic target in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)-an incurable 
      progressive fibrotic disease. IPF fibroblasts showed increased expression of TG2, 
      alpha smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA) and fibronectin (FN) with increased extracellular 
      TG2 and transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1) compared to normal human lung 
      fibroblasts (NHLFs) which do not express alphaSMA and express lower levels of FN. The 
      myofibroblast phenotype shown by IPF fibroblasts could be reversed by selective 
      TG2 inhibition with a reduction in matrix FN and TGFbeta1 deposition. TG2 
      transduction or TGFbeta1 treatment of NHLFs led to a comparable phenotype to that of 
      IPF fibroblasts which was reversible following selective TG2 inhibition. Addition 
      of exogenous TG2 to NHLFs also induced the myofibroblast phenotype by a mechanism 
      involving TGFbeta1 activation which could be ameliorated by selective TG2 
      inhibition. SMAD3-deleted IPF fibroblasts via CRISPR-cas9 genome editing, showed 
      reduced TG2 protein levels following TGFbeta1 stimulation. This study demonstrates a 
      key role for TG2 in the induction of the myofibroblast phenotype and shows the 
      potential for TG2-selective inhibitors as therapeutic agents for the treatment of 
      fibrotic lung diseases like IPF.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare yet crucial persistent lung 
      disorder that actuates scarring of lung tissues, which makes breathing difficult. 
      Smoking, environmental pollution, and certain viral infections could initiate 
      lung scarring. However, the molecular mechanism involved in IPF remains elusive. 
      To develop an efficient therapeutic arsenal against IPF, it is vital to 
      understand the pathology and deviations in biochemical pathways that lead to 
      disorder. In this study, we availed network analysis and other computational 
      pipelines to delineate the prominent membrane proteins as diagnostic biomarkers 
      and therapeutic targets for IPF. This study yielded a significant role of 
      glycosaminoglycan binding, endothelin, and GABA-B receptor signaling pathway in 
      IPF pathogenesis. Furthermore, ADCY8, CRH, FGB, GPR17, MCHR1, NMUR1, and SAA1 
      genes were found to be immensely involved with IPF, and the enrichment pathway 
      analysis suggests that most of the pathways were corresponding to membrane 
      transport and signal transduction functionalities. This analysis could help in 
      better understanding the molecular mechanism behind IPF to develop an efficient 
      therapeutic target or biomarkers for IPF.

TI  - Autoantibodies targeting telomere-associated proteins in systemic sclerosis.
PG  - 912-919
LID - 10.1136/annrheumdis-2020-218918 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune fibrotic disease affecting 
      multiple tissues including the lung. A subset of patients with SSc with lung 
      disease exhibit short telomeres in circulating lymphocytes, but the mechanisms 
      underlying this observation are unclear. METHODS: Sera from the Johns Hopkins and 
      University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Scleroderma Centers were screened 
      for autoantibodies targeting telomerase and the shelterin proteins using 
      immunoprecipitation and ELISA. We determined the relationship between 
      autoantibodies targeting the shelterin protein TERF1 and telomere length in 
      peripheral leucocytes measured by qPCR and flow cytometry and fluorescent in situ 
      hybridisation (Flow-FISH). We also explored clinical associations of these 
      autoantibodies. RESULTS: In a subset of patients with SSc, we identified 
      autoantibodies targeting telomerase and the shelterin proteins that were rarely 
      present in rheumatoid arthritis, myositis and healthy controls. TERF1 
      autoantibodies were present in 40/442 (9.0%) patients with SSc and were 
      associated with severe lung disease (OR 2.4, p=0.04, Fisher's exact test) and 
      short lymphocyte telomere length. 6/6 (100%) patients with TERF1 autoantibodies 
      in the Hopkins cohort and 14/18 (78%) patients in the UCSF cohort had a shorter 
      telomere length in lymphocytes or leukocytes, respectively, relative to the 
      expected age-adjusted telomere length. TERF1 autoantibodies were present in 
      11/152 (7.2%) patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a fibrotic lung 
      disease believed to be mediated by telomere dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Autoantibodies targeting telomere-associated proteins in a subset of patients 
      with SSc are associated with short lymphocyte telomere length and lung disease. 
      The specificity of these autoantibodies for SSc and IPF suggests that telomere 
      dysfunction may have a distinct role in the pathogenesis of SSc and pulmonary 
      fibrosis.

TI  - Aucuparin Suppresses Bleomycin-Induced Pulmonary Fibrosis Via Anti-Inflammatory 
      Activity.
PG  - 151-160
LID - 10.1089/jmf.2020.4861 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lung disease that results in scarring of 
      the lungs for an unknown reason. Although many studies have been conducted on 
      IPF, precise mechanisms and treatments have not yet been identified. In this 
      study, we found that aucuparin, a natural product isolated from Sorbus aucuparia, 
      inhibited pulmonary fibrosis in a bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung fibrosis mouse 
      model. In the lung samples of mice treated with aucuparin, the gene expression of 
      inflammation and macrophage activation markers was reduced compared to those 
      treated with BLM alone. Moreover, aucuparin decreased the expression of 
      profibrotic marker genes and increased the expression of antifibrotic marker 
      genes. Finally, we observed that aucuparin significantly suppressed transforming 
      growth factor-beta-induced activation of inflammatory cytokine production and 
      collagen synthesis from macrophages and fibroblasts, respectively. Taken 
      together, these data demonstrate that aucuparin inhibits lung fibrosis via its 
      anti-inflammatory action and support its potential to be a therapeutic drug for 
      IPF treatment.

AB  - There have been recent extensive studies and rapid advancement on the 
      pathogenesis underlying idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and intricate 
      pathogenesis of IPF has been suggested. The purpose of this study was to clarify 
      the logical relationship between these mechanisms. An extensive search was 
      undertaken of the PubMed using the following keywords: "etiology," 
      "pathogenesis," "alveolar epithelial cell (AEC)," "fibroblast," "lymphocyte," 
      "macrophage," "epigenomics," "histone," acetylation," "methylation," "endoplasmic 
      reticulum stress," "mitochondrial dysfunction," "telomerase," "proteases," 
      "plasminogen," "epithelial-mesenchymal transition," "oxidative stress," 
      "inflammation," "apoptosis," and "idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis." This search 
      covered relevant research articles published up to April 30, 2020. Original 
      articles, reviews, and other articles were searched and reviewed for content; 240 
      highly relevant studies were obtained after screening. IPF is likely the result 
      of complex interactions between environmental, genetic, and epigenetic factors: 
      environmental exposures affect epigenetic marks; epigenetic processes translate 
      environmental exposures into the regulation of chromatin; epigenetic processes 
      shape gene expression profiles; in turn, an individual's genetic background 
      determines epigenetic marks; finally, these genetic and epigenetic factors act in 
      concert to dysregulate gene expression in IPF lung tissue. The pathogenesis of 
      IPF involves various imbalances including endoplasmic reticulum, telomere length 
      homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidant/antioxidant imbalance, Th1/Th2 
      imbalance, M1-M2 polarization of macrophages, protease/antiprotease imbalance, 
      and plasminogen activation/inhibition imbalance. These affect each other, promote 
      each other, and ultimately promote AEC/fibroblast apoptosis imbalance directly or 
      indirectly. Excessive AEC apoptosis and impaired apoptosis of fibroblasts 
      contribute to fibrosis. IPF is likely the result of complex interactions between 
      environmental, genetic, and epigenetic factors. The pathogenesis of IPF involves 
      various imbalances centered on AEC/fibroblast apoptosis imbalance.

AB  - Rationale: (Myo)fibroblasts are the ultimate effector cells responsible for the 
      production of collagen within alveolar structures, a core phenomenon in the 
      pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Although 
      (myo)fibroblast-targeted therapy holds great promise for suppressing the 
      progression of IPF, its development is hindered by the limited drug delivery 
      efficacy to (myo)fibroblasts and the vicious circle of (myo)fibroblast activation 
      and evasion of apoptosis. Methods: Here, a dual small interfering RNA 
      (siRNA)-loaded delivery system of polymeric micelles is developed to suppress the 
      development of pulmonary fibrosis via a two-arm mechanism. The micelles are 
      endowed with (myo)fibroblast-targeting ability by modifying the Fab' fragment of 
      the anti-platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFRalpha) antibody onto their 
      surface. Two different sequences of siRNA targeting protein tyrosine 
      phosphatase-N13 (PTPN13, a promoter of the resistance of (myo)fibroblasts to 
      Fas-induced apoptosis) and NADPH oxidase-4 (NOX4, a key regulator for 
      (myo)fibroblast differentiation and activation) are loaded into micelles to 
      inhibit the formation of fibroblastic foci. Results: We demonstrate that 
      Fab'-conjugated dual siRNA-micelles exhibit higher affinity to (myo)fibroblasts 
      in fibrotic lung tissue. This Fab'-conjugated dual siRNA-micelle can achieve 
      remarkable antifibrotic effects on the formation of fibroblastic foci by, on the 
      one hand, suppressing (myo)fibroblast activation via siRNA-induced knockdown of 
      NOX4 and, on the other hand, sensitizing (myo)fibroblasts to Fas-induced 
      apoptosis by siRNA-mediated PTPN13 silencing. In addition, this 
      (myo)fibroblast-targeting siRNA-loaded micelle did not induce significant damage 
      to major organs, and no histopathological abnormities were observed in murine 
      models. Conclusion: The (myo)fibroblast-targeting dual siRNA-loaded micelles 
      offer a potential strategy with promising prospects in molecular-targeted 
      fibrosis therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most common interstitial 
      lung diseases with a poor prognosis. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been 
      reported to be involved in IPF in several studies. However, the role of lncRNA 
      SNHG16 in IPF is largely unknown. METHODS: Firstly, experimental pulmonary 
      fibrosis model was established by using bleomycin (BML). Histology and Western 
      blotting assays were used to determine the different stages of fibrosis and 
      expression of several fibrosis biomarkers. The expression of SNHG16 was detected 
      by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). EdU staining and 
      wound-healing assay were utilized to analyze proliferation and migration of lung 
      fibroblast cells. Molecular mechanism of SNHG16 was explored by bioinformatics, 
      dual-luciferase reporter assay, RNA immunoprecipitation assay (RIP), and qRT-PCR. 
      RESULTS: The expression of SNHG16 was significantly up-regulated in 
      bleomycin-(BLM) induced lung fibrosis and transforming growth factor-beta 
      (TGF-beta)-induced fibroblast. Knockdown of SNHG16 could attenuate fibrogenesis. 
      Mechanistically, SNHG16 was able to bind and regulate the expression of 
      miR-455-3p. Moreover, SNHG16 also regulated the expression of Notch2 by targeting 
      miR-455-3p. Finally, SNHG16 could promote fibrogenesis by regulating the 
      expression of Notch2. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our study demonstrated that 
      SNHG16 promoted pulmonary fibrosis by targeting miR-455-3p to regulate the Notch2 
      pathway. These findings might provide a novel insight into pathologic process of 
      lung fibrosis and may provide prevention strategies in the future.

      patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and improves their therapeutic 
      efficacy in experimental pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an age-related disease with no 
      cure. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapy has emerged as a novel strategy 
      for IPF treatment. Nevertheless, MSCs derived from patients with IPF (IPF-MSCs) 
      become senescent, thereby reducing their beneficial effects in IPF. MicroRNAs 
      (miRNAs) mediate the senescence of MSCs, but the underlying mechanisms are not 
      fully understood. We investigated the mechanisms by which miR-199a-5p regulates 
      IPF-MSC senescence and whether its inhibition could rejuvenate IPF-MSCs and 
      enhance their therapeutic efficacy. METHODS: Control-MSCs and IPF-MSCs were 
      isolated from the adipose tissue of age-matched healthy and IPF donors, 
      respectively. Cell senescence was examined by senescence-associated 
      beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal) staining. The level of miR-199a-5p was measured by 
      RT-PCR. Autophagy was determined using a transmission electron microscope (TEM). 
      The therapeutic efficacy of anti-miR-199a-5p-IPF-MSCs was assessed using a mouse 
      model of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. RESULTS: Despite similar surface 
      makers, IPF-MSCs exhibited increased cellular senescence and decreased 
      proliferative capacity compared with control-MSCs. The expression of miR-199a-5p 
      was significantly enhanced in the serum of IPF patients and IPF-MSCs compared 
      with that of healthy donors and control-MSCs. The upregulation of miR-199a-5p 
      induced senescence of control-MSCs, whereas the downregulation rescued IPF-MSC 
      senescence. Mechanistically, miR-155-5p suppressed autophagy of MSCs via the AMPK 
      signaling pathway by downregulating the expression of Sirtuin 1(Sirt1), resulting 
      in cellular senescence. Accordingly, miR-155-5p inhibition promoted autophagy and 
      ameliorated IPF-MSC senescence by activating the Sirt1/AMPK signaling pathway. 
      Compared with IPF-MSCs, the transplantation of anti-miR-199a-5p-IPF-MSCs 
      increased the ability to prevent progression of pulmonary fibrosis in 
      bleomycin-treated mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that miR-199a-5p regulates 
      MSC senescence in patients with IPF by regulating the Sirt1/AMPK signaling 
      pathway and miR-199a-5p is a novel target to rejuvenate IPF-MSCs and enhance 
      their beneficial effects.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Air pollution exposure and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) cause 
      a poor prognosis after SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the underlying mechanisms are 
      not well explored. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane 
      serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) are the keys to the entry of SARS-CoV-2. We therefore 
      hypothesized that air pollution exposure and IPF may increase the expression of 
      ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the lung alveolar region. We measured their expression levels 
      in lung tissues of control non-IPF and IPF patients, and used murine animal 
      models to study the deterioration of IPF caused by particulate matter (PM) and 
      the molecular pathways involved in the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. RESULTS: 
      In non-IPF patients, cells expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were limited to human 
      alveolar cells. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were largely upregulated in IPF patients, and 
      were co-expressed by fibroblast specific protein 1 (FSP-1) + lung fibroblasts in 
      human pulmonary fibrotic tissue. In animal models, PM exposure increased the 
      severity of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were also 
      expressed in FSP-1+ lung fibroblasts in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, and 
      when combined with PM exposure, they were further upregulated. The severity of 
      pulmonary fibrosis and the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 caused by PM exposure 
      were blocked by deletion of KC, a murine homologue of IL-8, or treatment with 
      reparixin, an inhibitor of IL-8 receptors CXCR1/2. CONCLUSIONS: These data 
      suggested that risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease severity 
      increased by air pollution exposure and underlying IPF. It can be mediated 
      through upregulating ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in pulmonary fibroblasts, and prevented by 
      blocking the IL-8/CXCR1/2 pathway.

TI  - Hyaluronan/CD44 axis regulates S100A4-mediated mesenchymal progenitor cell 
      fibrogenicity in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - L926-L941
LID - 10.1152/ajplung.00456.2020 [doi]
AB  - Despite modest improvement in patient outcomes from recent advances in 
      pharmacotherapy targeting fibrogenic signaling pathways, idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF) remains a major unsolved clinical problem. One reason for this is 
      that available antifibrotic agents slow down but do not arrest fibrotic 
      progression. To arrest fibrotic progression, its obligatory drivers need to be 
      identified. We previously discovered that fibrogenic mesenchymal progenitor cells 
      (MPCs) are key drivers of fibrotic progression in IPF, serving as cells of origin 
      for disease-mediating myofibroblasts. IPF MPCs have high levels of nuclear 
      S100A4, which interacts with the proteasome to promote p53 degradation and 
      self-renewal. However, the mechanism underlying S100A4 accumulation in the 
      nucleus of IPF MPCs remains unknown. Here we show that hyaluronan (HA) is present 
      in the fibroblastic focus together with CD44-expressing MPCs and that ligation of 
      CD44 by HA triggers S100A4 nuclear translocation to support IPF MPC self-renewal. 
      The mechanism involves HA-mediated formation of a CD44/S100A4/transportin 1 
      complex, which promotes S100A4 nuclear import. In a humanized mouse model of 
      pulmonary fibrosis, IPF MPC fibrogenicity was significantly attenuated by 1) 
      knockdown of CD44 or 2) introduction of an S100A4 mutant construct that prevents 
      S100A4 nuclear import. These data indicate that signaling through the 
      HA/CD44/S100A4 axis is an integral component of IPF MPC fibrogenicity.

TI  - LncRNA CHRF promotes TGF-beta1 induced EMT in alveolar epithelial cells by 
      inhibiting miR-146a up-regulating L1CAM expression.
PG  - 198-209
LID - 10.1080/01902148.2021.1891354 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a type of progressive lung 
      fibrosis disease. The survival time of diagnosed IPF patients is often only 2 
      years. Currently much evidence showed that the epithelial-mesenchymal transition 
      (EMT) process is the main cause of the occurrence and development of IPF. LncRNA 
      cardiac hypertrophy related factor (CHRF) was reported to be related with IPF 
      development. Here we explored the functions and regulatory mechanisms of CHRF on 
      EMT in IPF. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A549 cells were treated with transforming 
      growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) for 48 h to construct IPF cell model. CHRF and miR-146a 
      expression were quantified using qPCR. The expression of L1 cell adhesion 
      molecule (L1CAM) and EMT related indicators (E-cadherin, Vimentin, Slug and 
      N-cadherin) were detected by qPCR and western blot. Dual luciferase reporter 
      experiment was conducted to prove the molecular interaction of miR-146a and 
      L1CAM, as well as CHRF and miR-146a. RESULTS: CHRF and L1CAM expression were 
      significantly upregulated and promoted the EMT process in A549 after treatment of 
      TGF-beta1. MiR-146a was obviously down-regulated, and knockdown of CHRF inhibited 
      the EMT process by up-regulating miR-146a, in A549 after treatment of TGF-beta1. 
      Meanwhile, overexpression of miR-146a inhibited EMT process via targeting L1CAM. 
      In addition, L1CAM overexpression eliminated the inhibitory effect of sh-CHRF on 
      the EMT process. CONCLUSIONS: These results provided evidence that CHRF promoted 
      EMT process in A549 after treatment of TGF-beta1, which proposed a new insight for 
      depth understanding the pathological mechanisms of IPF.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive and debilitating lung disease with 
      large unmet medical need and few treatment options. We describe an analysis 
      connecting single cell gene expression with bulk gene expression-based subsetting 
      of patient cohorts to identify IPF patient subsets with different underlying 
      pathogenesis and cellular changes. We reproduced earlier findings indicating the 
      existence of two major subsets in IPF and showed that these subsets display 
      different alterations in cellular composition of the lung. We developed 
      classifiers based on the cellular changes in disease to distinguish subsets. 
      Specifically, we showed that one subset of IPF patients had significant increases 
      in gene signature scores for myeloid cells versus a second subset that had 
      significantly increased gene signature scores for ciliated epithelial cells, 
      suggesting a differential pathogenesis among IPF subsets. Ligand-receptor 
      analyses suggested there was a monocyte-macrophage chemoattractant axis 
      (including potentially CCL2-CCR2 and CCL17-CCR4) among the myeloid-enriched IPF 
      subset and a ciliated epithelium-derived chemokine axis (e.g. CCL15) among the 
      ciliated epithelium-enriched IPF subset. We also found that these IPF subsets had 
      differential expression of pirfenidone-responsive genes suggesting that our 
      findings may provide an approach to identify patients with differential responses 
      to pirfenidone and other drugs. We believe this work is an important step towards 
      targeted therapies and biomarkers of response.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal disorder characterised by 
      progressive, destructive lung scarring. Despite substantial progress, the genetic 
      determinants of this disease remain incompletely defined. Using whole genome and 
      whole exome sequencing data from 752 individuals with sporadic IPF and 119,055 UK 
      Biobank controls, we performed a variant-level exome-wide association study 
      (ExWAS) and gene-level collapsing analyses. Our variant-level analysis revealed a 
      novel association between a rare missense variant in SPDL1 and 
      IPF (NM_017785.5:g.169588475 G > A p.Arg20Gln; p = 2.4 x 10(-7), odds ratio = 
      2.87, 95% confidence interval: 2.03-4.07). This signal was independently 
      replicated in the FinnGen cohort, which contains 1028 cases and 196,986 controls 
      (combined p = 2.2 x 10(-20)), firmly associating this variant as an IPF risk 
      allele. SPDL1 encodes Spindly, a protein involved in mitotic checkpoint 
      signalling during cell division that has not been previously described in 
      fibrosis. To the best of our knowledge, these results highlight a novel mechanism 
      underlying IPF, providing the potential for new therapeutic discoveries in a 
      disease of great unmet need.

      Pulmonary Fibrosis.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22073331 [doi]
LID - 3331
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive lung disease with poor 
      prognosis. The IPF-conditioned matrix (IPF-CM) system enables the study of 
      matrix-fibroblast interplay. While effective at slowing fibrosis, nintedanib has 
      limitations and the mechanism is not fully elucidated. In the current work, we 
      explored the underlying signaling pathways and characterized nintedanib 
      involvement in the IPF-CM fibrotic process. Results were validated using IPF 
      patient samples and bleomycin-treated animals with/without oral and inhaled 
      nintedanib. IPF-derived primary human lung fibroblasts (HLFs) were cultured on 
      Matrigel and then cleared using NH(4)OH, creating the IPF-CM. Normal HLF-CM 
      served as control. RNA-sequencing, PCR and western-blots were performed. HIF1alpha 
      targets were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in bleomycin-treated rats 
      with/without nintedanib and in patient samples with IPF. HLFs cultured on IPF-CM 
      showed over-expression of 'HIF1alpha signaling pathway' (KEGG, p < 0.0001), with 
      emphasis on SERPINE1 (PAI-1), VEGFA and TIMP1. IPF patient samples showed high 
      HIF1alpha staining, especially in established fibrous tissue. PAI-1 was 
      overexpressed, mainly in alveolar macrophages. Nintedanib completely reduced 
      HIF1alpha upregulation in the IPF-CM and rat-bleomycin models. IPF-HLFs alter the 
      extracellular matrix, thus creating a matrix that further propagates an IPF-like 
      phenotype in normal HLFs. This pro-fibrotic loop includes the HIF1alpha pathway, 
      which can be blocked by nintedanib.

TI  - Loss of MT1-MMP in Alveolar Epithelial Cells Exacerbates Pulmonary Fibrosis.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22062923 [doi]
LID - 2923
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal age-related lung disease whose 
      pathogenesis involves an aberrant response of alveolar epithelial cells (AEC). 
      Activated epithelial cells secrete mediators that participate in the activation 
      of fibroblasts and the excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins. 
      Previous studies indicate that matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14) is increased 
      in the lung epithelium in patients with IPF, however, the role of this 
      membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase has not been elucidated. In this study, 
      the role of Mmp14 was explored in experimental lung fibrosis induced with 
      bleomycin in a conditional mouse model of lung epithelial MMP14-specific genetic 
      deletion. Our results show that epithelial Mmp14 deficiency in mice increases the 
      severity and extension of fibrotic injury and affects the resolution of the 
      lesions. Gain-and loss-of-function experiments with human epithelial cell line 
      A549 demonstrated that cells with a deficiency of MMP14 exhibited increased 
      senescence-associated markers. Moreover, conditioned medium from these cells 
      increased fibroblast expression of fibrotic molecules. These findings suggest a 
      new anti-fibrotic mechanism of MMP14 associated with anti-senescent activity, and 
      consequently, its absence results in impaired lung repair. Increased MMP14 in IPF 
      may represent an anti-fibrotic mechanism that is overwhelmed by the strong 
      profibrotic microenvironment that characterizes this disease.

LID - 10.3390/jcm10061330 [doi]
LID - 1330
AB  - A significant proportion of patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) may 
      develop a progressive fibrosing phenotype characterized by worsening of symptoms 
      and pulmonary function, progressive fibrosis on chest computed tomography and 
      increased mortality. The clinical course in these patients mimics the relentless 
      progressiveness of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Common pathophysiological 
      mechanisms such as a shared genetic susceptibility and a common downstream 
      pathway-self-sustaining fibroproliferation-support the concept of a progressive 
      fibrosing phenotype, which is applicable to a broad range of non-IPF ILDs. While 
      antifibrotic drugs became the standard of care in IPF, immunosuppressive agents 
      are still the mainstay of treatment in non-IPF fibrosing ILD (F-ILD). However, 
      recently, randomized placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy and 
      safety of antifibrotic treatment in systemic sclerosis-associated F-ILD and a 
      broad range of F-ILDs with a progressive phenotype. This review summarizes the 
      current pharmacological management and highlights the unmet needs in patients 
      with non-IPF ILD.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and systemic sclerosis-associated 
      interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) differ in the predominant demographics and 
      identified genetic risk alleles of effected patients, however both diseases 
      frequently progress to respiratory failure and death. Contrasting advanced 
      SSc-ILD to IPF provides insight to the role dysregulated immunity may play in 
      pulmonary fibrosis. To analyze cell-type specific transcriptome commonalities and 
      differences between IPF and SSc-ILD, we compared single-cell RNA-sequencing 
      (scRNA-seq) of 21 explanted lung tissue specimens from patients with advanced 
      IPF, SSc-ILD, and organ donor controls. Comparison of IPF and SSc-ILD tissue 
      identified divergent patterns of interferon signaling, with interferon-gamma 
      signaling upregulated in the SPP1(hi) and FABP4(hi) macrophages, cytotoxic T 
      cells, and natural kill cells of IPF, while type I interferon signaling and 
      production was upregulated in the corresponding SSc-ILD populations. Plasmacytoid 
      dendritic cells were found in diseased lungs only, and exhibited upregulated 
      cellular stress pathways in SSc-ILD compared to IPF. Alveolar type I cells were 
      dramatically decreased in both IPF and SSc-ILD, with a distinct transcriptome 
      signature separating these cells by disease. KRT5(-)/KRT17(+) aberrant basaloid 
      cells exhibiting markers of cellular senescence and epithelial-mesenchymal 
      transition were identified in SSc-ILD for the first time. In summary, our study 
      utilizes the enriched capabilities of scRNA-seq to identify key divergent cell 
      types and pathways between IPF and SSc-ILD, providing new insights into the 
      shared and distinct mechanisms between idiopathic and autoimmune interstitial 
      lung diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare form of immune-mediated 
      interstitial lung disease characterized by progressive pulmonary fibrosis and 
      scarring. The pathogenesis of IPF is still unclear. Gene fusion events exist 
      universally during transcription and show alternated patterns in a variety of 
      lung diseases. Therefore, the comprehension of the function of gene fusion in IPF 
      might shed light on IPF pathogenesis research and facilitate treatment 
      development. METHODS: In this study, we included 91 transcriptome datasets from 
      the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), including 52 IPF 
      patients and 39 healthy controls. We detected fusion events in these datasets and 
      probed gene fusion-associated differential gene expression and functional 
      pathways. To obtain robust results, we corrected the batch bias across different 
      projects. RESULTS: We identified 1550 gene fusion events in all transcriptomes 
      and studied the possible impacts of IL7 = AC083837.1 gene fusion. The two genes 
      locate adjacently in chromosome 8 and share the same promoters. Their fusion is 
      associated with differential expression of 282 genes enriched in six Kyoto 
      Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways and 35 functional gene sets. 
      Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis shows that IL7 = AC083837.1 gene fusion is 
      associated with the enrichment of 187 gene sets. The co-expression network of 
      interleukin-7 (IL7) indicates that decreased IL7 expression is associated with 
      many pathways that regulate IPF progress. CONCLUSION: Based on the results, we 
      conclude that IL7 = AC083837.1 gene fusion might exacerbate fibrosis in IPF via 
      enhancing activities of natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, skin cell 
      apoptosis, and vessel angiogenesis, the interaction of which contributes to the 
      development of fibrosis and the deterioration of respiratory function of IPF 
      patients. Our work unveils the possible roles of gene fusion in regulating IPF 
      and demonstrates that gene fusion investigation is a valid approach in probing 
      immunologic mechanisms and searching potential therapeutic targets for treating 
      IPF.The reviews of this paper are available via the supplemental material 
      section.

TI  - Alveolar epithelial TET2 is not involved in the development of bleomycin-induced 
      pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - e21599
LID - 10.1096/fj.202002686RR [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disease of unknown etiology 
      with minimal treatment options. Repetitive alveolar epithelial injury has been 
      suggested as one of the causative mechanisms of this disease. Type 2 alveolar 
      epithelial cells (AEC2) play a crucial role during fibrosis by functioning as 
      stem cells able to repair epithelial damage. The DNA demethylase Tet 
      methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2) regulates the stemness of multiple types of 
      stem cells, but whether it also affects the stemness of AEC2 during fibrosis 
      remains elusive. To study the role of TET2 in AEC2 during fibrosis, we first 
      determined TET2 protein levels in the lungs of IPF patients and compared TET2 
      expression in AEC2 of IPF patients and controls using publicly available data 
      sets. Subsequently, pulmonary fibrosis was induced by the intranasal 
      administration of bleomycin to wild-type and AEC2-specific TET2 knockout mice to 
      determine the role of TET2 in vivo. Fibrosis was assessed by hydroxyproline 
      analysis and fibrotic gene expression. Additionally, macrophage recruitment and 
      activation, and epithelial injury were analyzed. TET2 protein levels and gene 
      expression were downregulated in IPF lungs and AEC2, respectively. Bleomycin 
      inoculation induced a robust fibrotic response as indicated by increased 
      hydroxyproline levels and increased expression of pro-fibrotic genes. 
      Additionally, increased macrophage recruitment and both M1 and M2 activation were 
      observed. None of these parameters were, however, affected by AEC2-specific TET2 
      deficiency. TET2 expression is reduced in IPF, but the absence of TET2 in AEC2 
      cells does not affect the development of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease 
      resulting in respiratory failure with no efficient treatment options. We 
      investigated the protective effect of RS4651 on pulmonary fibrosis in mice and 
      the mechanism. METHODS: Intratracheal injection of bleomycin (BLM) was used to 
      induce pulmonary fibrosis in mice. RS4561 was administered intraperitoneally at 
      different doses. Histopathological changes were observed. The level of 
      alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) were also tested. In vitro, the proliferation 
      and migratory effects of RS4651 treatment on MRC-5 cells pre-treated with 
      transforming growth factor (TGF-beta1) were examined. RNA-sequencing was used to 
      detect differentially expressed target genes. Then, the expression of alpha-SMA, 
      pSMAD2 and SMAD7 were analysed during RS4651 treatment of MRC-5 cells with or 
      without silencing by SMAD7 siRNA. RESULTS: Histopathological staining results 
      showed decreased collagen deposition in RS4651 administered mice. Additionally, a 
      lower level of alpha-SMA was also observed compared to the BLM group. The results of 
      in vitro studies confirmed that RS4651 can inhibit the proliferation and 
      migration, as well as alpha-SMA and pSMAD2 expression in MRC-5 cells treated with 
      TGF-beta1. RNA-sequencing data identified the target gene SMAD7. We found that 
      RS4651 could upregulate SMAD7 expression and inhibit the proliferation and 
      migration of MRC-5 cells via SMAD7, and RS4651 inhibition of alpha-SMA and pSMAD2 
      expression was blocked in SMAD7-siRNA MRC-5 cells. In vivo studies further 
      confirmed that RS4651 could upregulate SMAD7 expression in BLM-induced lung 
      fibrosis in mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that RS4651 alleviates 
      BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice by inhibiting the TGF-beta1/SMAD signalling 
      pathway.

AB  - Innate lymphoid type-2 cells (ILC2) are a population of innate cells of lymphoid 
      origin that are known to drive strong Type 2 immunity. ILC2 play a key role in 
      lung homeostasis, repair/remodeling of lung structures following injury, and 
      initiation of inflammation as well as more complex roles during the immune 
      response, including the transition from innate to adaptive immunity. Remarkably, 
      dysregulation of this single population has been linked with chronic lung 
      pathologies, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrotic diseases (IPF). Furthermore, ILC2 have been shown 
      to increase following early-life respiratory viral infections, such as 
      respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus (RV), that may lead to long-term 
      alterations of the lung environment. The detrimental roles of increased ILC2 
      following these infections may include pathogenic chronic inflammation and/or 
      alterations of the structural, repair, and even developmental processes of the 
      lung. Respiratory viral infections in older adults and patients with established 
      chronic pulmonary diseases often lead to exacerbated responses, likely due to 
      previous exposures that leave the lung in a dysregulated functional and 
      structural state. This review will focus on the role of ILC2 during respiratory 
      viral exposures and their effects on the induction and regulation of lung 
      pathogenesis. We aim to provide insight into ILC2-driven mechanisms that may 
      enhance lung-associated diseases throughout life. Understanding these mechanisms 
      will help identify better treatment options to limit not only viral infection 
      severity but also protect against the development and/or exacerbation of other 
      lung pathologies linked to severe respiratory viral infections.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an orphan disease 
      characterized by progressive loss of lung function resulting in shortness of 
      breath and often death within 3-4 years of diagnosis. Repetitive lung injury in 
      susceptible individuals is believed to promote chronic oxidative stress, 
      inflammation, and uncontrolled collagen deposition. Several preclinical and 
      retrospective clinical studies in IPF have reported beneficial outcomes 
      associated with the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) such as esomeprazole. 
      Accordingly, we sought to investigate molecular mechanism(s) by which PPIs 
      favorably regulate the disease process. METHODS: We stimulated oxidative stress, 
      pro-inflammatory and profibrotic phenotypes in primary human lung epithelial 
      cells and fibroblasts upon treatment with bleomycin or transforming growth factor 
      beta (TGFbeta) and assessed the effect of a prototype PPI, esomeprazole, in regulating 
      these processes. RESULTS: Our study shows that esomeprazole controls 
      pro-inflammatory and profibrotic molecules through nuclear translocation of the 
      transcription factor nuclear factor-like 2 (Nrf2) and induction of the 
      cytoprotective molecule heme oxygenase 1 (HO1). Genetic deletion of Nrf2 or 
      pharmacological inhibition of HO1 impaired esomeprazole-mediated regulation of 
      proinflammatory and profibrotic molecules. Additional studies indicate that 
      activation of Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway is involved in the 
      process. Our experimental data was corroborated by bioinformatics studies of an 
      NIH chemical library which hosts gene expression profiles of IPF lung fibroblasts 
      treated with over 20,000 compounds including esomeprazole. Intriguingly, we found 
      45 genes that are upregulated in IPF but downregulated by esomeprazole. Pathway 
      analysis showed that these genes are enriched for profibrotic processes. Unbiased 
      high throughput RNA-seq study supported antifibrotic effect of esomeprazole and 
      revealed several novel targets. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, PPIs may play 
      antifibrotic role in IPF through direct regulation of the MAPK/Nrf2/HO1 pathway 
      to favorably influence the disease process in IPF.

TI  - Novel insights into surfactant protein C trafficking revealed through the study 
      of a pathogenic mutant.
LID - 10.1183/13993003.00267-2021 [doi]
LID - 2100267
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alveolar epithelial cell dysfunction plays an important role in the 
      pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), but remains incompletely 
      understood. Some monogenic forms of pulmonary fibrosis are associated with 
      expression of mutant surfactant protein C (SFTPC). The commonest pathogenic 
      mutant, I73T, mislocalises to the alveolar epithelial cell plasma membrane and 
      displays a toxic gain of function. Because the mechanisms explaining the link 
      between this mutant and IPF are incompletely understood, we sought to interrogate 
      SFTPC trafficking in health and disease to understand the functional significance 
      of SFTPC-I73T relocalisation. METHODS: We performed mechanistic analysis of SFTPC 
      trafficking in a cell model that reproduces the in vivo phenotype and validated 
      findings in human primary alveolar organoids. RESULTS: We show that wild-type 
      SFTPC takes an unexpected indirect trafficking route via the plasma membrane and 
      undergoes the first of multiple cleavage events before reaching the 
      multivesicular body (MVB) for further processing. SFTPC-I73T takes this same 
      route, but its progress is retarded both at the cell surface and due to failure 
      of trafficking into the MVB. Unable to undergo onward trafficking, it is recycled 
      to the plasma membrane as a partially cleaved intermediate. CONCLUSION: These 
      data show for the first time that all SFTPC transits the cell surface during 
      normal trafficking, and the I73T mutation accumulates at the cell surface through 
      both retarded trafficking and active recycling. This understanding of normal 
      SFTPC trafficking and how the I73T mutant disturbs it provides novel insight into 
      SFTPC biology in health and disease, and in the contribution of the SFTPC mutant 
      to IPF development.

LID - 10.3390/ijms22115909 [doi]
LID - 5909
AB  - We developed two models of chemically induced chronic lung injury and pulmonary 
      fibrosis in mice (intratracheally administered hydrochloric acid (HCl) and 
      intratracheally administered nitrogen mustard (NM)) and investigated male-female 
      differences. Female mice exhibited higher 30-day survival and less weight loss 
      than male mice. Thirty days after the instillation of either HCl or NM, 
      bronchoalveolar lavage fluid displayed a persistent, mild inflammatory response, 
      but with higher white blood cell numbers and total protein content in males vs. 
      females. Furthermore, females exhibited less collagen deposition, milder 
      pulmonary fibrosis, and lower Ashcroft scores. After instillation of either HCl 
      or NM, all animals displayed increased values of phosphorylated (activated) Heat 
      Shock Protein 90, which plays a crucial role in the alveolar wound-healing 
      processes; however, females presented lower activation of both transforming 
      growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling pathways: ERK and SMAD. We propose that female 
      mice are protected from chronic complications of a single exposure to either HCl 
      or NM through a lesser activation of TGF-beta and downstream signaling. The 
      understanding of the molecular mechanisms that confer a protective effect in 
      females could help develop new, gender-specific therapeutics for IPF.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest that transient receptor potential (TRP) 
      channels and neurogenic inflammation may be involved in idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF)-related high cough sensitivity, although the details of mechanism 
      are largely unknown. Here, we aimed to further explore the potential mechanism 
      involved in IPF-related high cough sensitivity to capsaicin challenge in a guinea 
      pig model of pulmonary fibrosis induced by bleomycin. METHODS: Western blotting 
      and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) were employed to 
      measure the expression of TRP channel subfamily A, member 1 (TRPA1) and TRP 
      vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), which may be involved in the cough reflex pathway. 
      Immunohistochemical analysis and RT-qPCR were used to detect the expression of 
      neuropeptides substance P (SP), Neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R), and calcitonin 
      gene-related peptide (CGRP) in lung tissues. Concentrations of nerve growth 
      factor (NGF), SP, neurokinin A (NKA), neurokinin B (NKB), and brain-derived 
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in lung tissue homogenates were measured by ELISA. 
      RESULTS: Cough sensitivity to capsaicin was significantly higher in the model 
      group than that of the sham group. RT-qPCR and immunohistochemical analysis 
      showed that the expression of TRPA1 and TRPV1 in the jugular ganglion and nodal 
      ganglion, and SP, NK1R, and CGRP in lung tissue was significantly higher in the 
      model group than the control group. In addition, expression of TRP and neurogenic 
      factors was positively correlated with cough sensitivity of the experimental 
      animals. CONCLUSION: Up-regulated expression of TRPA1 and TRPV1 in the cough 
      reflex pathway and neurogenic inflammation might contribute to the IPF-related 
      high cough sensitivity in guinea pig model.

AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as critical factors for regulating 
      multiple biological processes during organ fibrosis. However, the mechanism of 
      lncRNAs in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remains incompletely understood. 
      In the present study, two sets of lncRNAs were defined: IPF pathogenic lncRNAs 
      and IPF progression lncRNAs. IPF pathogenic and progression lncRNAs-mRNAs 
      co-expression networks were constructed to identify essential lncRNAs. Network 
      analysis revealed a key lncRNA CTD-2528L19.6, which was up-regulated in 
      early-stage IPF compared to normal lung tissue, and subsequently down-regulated 
      during advanced-stage IPF. CTD-2528L19.6 was indicated to regulate fibroblast 
      activation in IPF progression by mediating the expression of fibrosis related 
      genes LRRC8C, DDIT4, THBS1, S100A8 and TLR7 et al. Further studies showed that 
      silencing of CTD-2528L19.6 increases the expression of Fn1 and Collagen I both at 
      mRNA and protein levels, promoted the transition of fibroblasts into 
      myofibroblasts and accelerated the migration and proliferation of MRC-5 cells. In 
      contrast, CTD-2528L19.6 overexpression alleviated fibroblast activation in MRC-5 
      cells induced by TGF-beta1. LncRNA CTD-2528L19.6 inhibited fibroblast activation 
      through regulating the expression of LRRC8C in vitro assays. Our results suggest 
      that CTD-2528L19.6 may prevent the progression of IPF from early-stage and 
      alleviate fibroblast activation during the advanced-stage of IPF. Thus, exploring 
      the regulatory effect of lncRNA CTD-2528L19.6 may provide new sights for the 
      prevention and treatment of IPF.

AB  - The family of RNA-binding proteins (RBP) functions as a crucial regulator of 
      multiple biological processes and diseases. However, RBP function in the clinical 
      setting of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is still unknown. We developed a 
      practical in silico screening approach for the characterization of RBPs using 
      multi-sources data information and comparative molecular network bioinformatics 
      followed by wet-lab validation studies. Data mining of bulk RNA-Sequencing data 
      of tissues of patients with IPF identified Quaking (QKI) as a significant 
      downregulated RBP. Cell-type specific expression was confirmed by single-cell 
      RNA-Sequencing analysis of IPF patient data. We systematically analyzed the 
      molecular interaction network around QKI and its functional interplay with 
      microRNAs (miRs) in human lung fibroblasts and discovered a novel regulatory 
      miR-506-QKI axis contributing to the pathogenesis of IPF. The in silico results 
      were validated by in-house experiments applying model systems of miR and lung 
      biology. This study supports an understanding of the intrinsic molecular 
      mechanisms of IPF regulated by the miR-506-QKI axis. Initially applied to human 
      lung disease, the herein presented integrative in silico data mining approach can 
      be adapted to other disease entities, underlining its practical relevance in RBP 
      research.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal interstitial lung disease with 
      limited therapeutic options. Current evidence suggests that IPF may be initiated 
      by repeated epithelial injuries in the distal lung, which are followed by 
      abnormal wound healing responses that occur because of intrinsic and extrinsic 
      factors. Mechanisms contributing to chronic damage of the alveolar epithelium in 
      IPF include dysregulated cellular processes such as apoptosis, senescence, 
      abnormal activation of the developmental pathways, aging, and genetic mutations. 
      Therefore, targeting the regenerative capacity of the lung epithelium is an 
      attractive approach in the development of novel therapies for IPF. Endogenous 
      lung regeneration is a complex process involving coordinated cross-talk among 
      multiple cell types and reestablishment of a normal extracellular matrix 
      environment. This review will describe the current knowledge of reparative 
      epithelial progenitor cells in the alveolar region of the lung and discuss 
      potential novel therapeutic approaches for IPF, focusing on endogenous alveolar 
      repair.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal interstitial lung 
      disease. During the past decade, novel pathogenic mechanisms of IPF have been 
      elucidated that have shifted the concept of IPF from an inflammatory-driven to an 
      epithelial-driven disease. Dysregulated repair responses induced by recurrent 
      epithelial cell damage and excessive extracellular matrix accumulation result in 
      pulmonary fibrosis. Although there is currently no curative therapy for IPF, two 
      medications, pirfenidone and nintedanib, have been introduced based on 
      understanding the pathogenesis of the disease. In this review, we discuss 
      advances in understanding IPF pathogenesis, highlighting epithelial-mesenchymal 
      transition (EMT), the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and endothelial cells. TGF-beta 
      is a central regulator involved in EMT and pulmonary fibrosis. HECT-, RING 
      finger-, and U-box-type E3 ubiquitin ligases regulate TGF-beta-Smad pathway-mediated 
      EMT via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. p27 degradation mediated by the 
      SCF-type E3 ligase, Skp2, contributes to the progression of pulmonary fibrosis by 
      promotion of either mesenchymal fibroblast proliferation, EMT, or both. In 
      addition to fibroblasts as key effector cells in myofibroblast differentiation 
      and extracellular matrix deposition, endothelial cells also play a role in the 
      processes of IPF. Endothelial cells can transform into myofibroblasts; therefore, 
      endothelial-mesenchymal transition can be another source of myofibroblasts.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), the most lethal form of interstitial 
      pneumonia of unknown cause, is associated with a specific radiological and 
      histopathological pattern (the so-called "usual interstitial pneumonia" pattern) 
      and has a median survival estimated to be between 3 and 5 years after diagnosis. 
      However, evidence shows that IPF has different clinical phenotypes, which are 
      characterized by a variable disease course over time. At present, the natural 
      history of IPF is unpredictable for individual patients, although some genetic 
      factors and circulating biomarkers have been associated with different prognoses. 
      Since in its early stages, IPF may be asymptomatic, leading to a delayed 
      diagnosis. Two drugs, pirfenidone and nintedanib, have been shown to modify the 
      disease course by slowing down the decline in lung function. It is also known 
      that 5-10% of the IPF patients may be affected by episodes of acute and often 
      fatal decline. The acute worsening of disease is sometimes attributed to 
      identifiable conditions, such as pneumonia or heart failure; but many of these 
      events occur without an identifiable cause. These idiopathic acute worsenings are 
      termed acute exacerbations of IPF. To date, clinical biomarkers, diagnostic, 
      prognostic, and theranostic, are not well characterized. However, they could 
      become useful tools helping facilitate diagnoses, monitoring disease progression 
      and treatment efficacy. The aim of this review is to cover molecular mechanisms 
      underlying IPF and research into new clinical biomarkers, to be utilized in 
      diagnosis and prognosis, even in patients treated with antifibrotic drugs.

      Fibrosis.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22116041 [doi]
LID - 6041
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is one of the most symptomatic progressive 
      fibrotic lung diseases, in which patients have an extremely poor prognosis. 
      Therefore, understanding the precise molecular mechanisms underlying pulmonary 
      fibrosis is necessary for the development of new therapeutic options. 
      Stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38) are ubiquitously expressed in various 
      types of cells and activated in response to cellular environmental stresses, 
      including inflammatory and apoptotic stimuli. Type II alveolar epithelial cells, 
      fibroblasts, and macrophages are known to participate in the progression of 
      pulmonary fibrosis. SAPKs can control fibrogenesis by regulating the cellular 
      processes and molecular functions in various types of lung cells (including cells 
      of the epithelium, interstitial connective tissue, blood vessels, and 
      hematopoietic and lymphoid tissue), all aspects of which remain to be elucidated. 
      We recently reported that the stepwise elevation of intrinsic p38 signaling in 
      the lungs is correlated with a worsening severity of bleomycin-induced fibrosis, 
      indicating an importance of this pathway in the progression of pulmonary 
      fibrosis. In addition, a transcriptome analysis of RNA-sequencing data from this 
      unique model demonstrated that several lines of mechanisms are involved in the 
      pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, which provides a basis for further studies. 
      Here, we review the accumulating evidence for the spatial and temporal roles of 
      SAPKs in pulmonary fibrosis.

      Mechanisms.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22126211 [doi]
LID - 6211
AB  - Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) comprise different fibrotic lung disorders 
      characterized by cellular proliferation, interstitial inflammation, and fibrosis. 
      The JAK/STAT molecular pathway is activated under the interaction of a broad 
      number of profibrotic/pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-11, and IL-13, 
      among others, which are increased in different ILDs. Similarly, several growth 
      factors over-expressed in ILDs, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), 
      transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 
      activate JAK/STAT by canonical or non-canonical pathways, which indicates a 
      predominant role of JAK/STAT in ILDs. Between the different JAK/STAT isoforms, it 
      appears that JAK2/STAT3 are predominant, initiating cellular changes observed in 
      ILDs. This review analyzes the expression and distribution of different JAK/STAT 
      isoforms in ILDs lung tissue and different cell types related to ILDs, such as 
      lung fibroblasts and alveolar epithelial type II cells and analyzes JAK/STAT 
      activation. The effect of JAK/STAT phosphorylation on cellular fibrotic 
      processes, such as proliferation, senescence, autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum 
      stress, or epithelial/fibroblast to mesenchymal transition will be described. The 
      small molecules directed to inhibit JAK/STAT activation were assayed in vitro and 
      in in vivo models of pulmonary fibrosis, and different JAK inhibitors are 
      currently approved for myeloproliferative disorders. Recent evidence indicates 
      that JAK inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies directed to block IL-6 are used as 
      compassionate use to attenuate the excessive inflammation and lung fibrosis 
      related to SARS-CoV-2 virus. These altogether indicate that JAK/STAT pathway is 
      an attractive target to be proven in future clinical trials of lung fibrotic 
      disorders.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung fibrosing disease with high 
      prevalence that has a prognosis worse than many cancers. There has been a recent 
      influx of new observations aimed at explaining the mechanisms responsible for the 
      initiation and progression of pulmonary fibrosis. However, despite this, the 
      pathogenesis of the disease is largely unclear. Recent progress has been made in 
      the characterization of specific pathologic and clinical features that have 
      enhanced the understanding of pathologically activated molecular pathways during 
      the onset and progression of IPF. This review highlights several of the advances 
      that have been made and focus on the pathobiology of IPF. The work also details 
      the different factors that are responsible for the disposition of the disease - 
      these may be internal factors such as cellular mechanisms and genetic 
      alterations, or they may be external factors from the environment. The changes 
      that primarily occur in epithelial cells and fibroblasts that lead to the 
      activation of profibrotic pathways are discussed in depth. Finally, a complete 
      repertoire of the treatment therapies that have been used in the past as well as 
      future medications and therapies is provided.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive, 
      irreversible, high-mortality lung disease, but its pathogenesis is still unclear. 
      Our purpose was to explore potential genes and molecular mechanisms underlying 
      IPF. METHODS: IPF-related data were obtained from the GSE99621 dataset. 
      Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between IPF and controls. 
      Their biological functions were analyzed. The relationships between DEGs and 
      microRNAs (miRNAs) were predicted. DEGs and pathways were validated in a 
      microarray dataset. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed 
      based on these common DEGs. Western blot was used to validate hub genes in IPF 
      cell models by western blot. RESULTS: DEGs were identified for IPF than controls 
      in the RNA-seq dataset. Functional enrichment analysis showed that these DEGs 
      were mainly enriched in immune and inflammatory response, chemokine-mediated 
      signaling pathway, cell adhesion, and other biological processes. In the 
      miRNA-target network based on RNA-seq dataset, we found several miRNA targets 
      among all DEGs, like RAB11FIP1, TGFBR3, and SPP1. We identified 304 upregulated 
      genes and 282 downregulated genes in IPF compared to controls both in the 
      microarray and RNA-seq datasets. These common DEGs were mainly involved in cell 
      adhesion, extracellular matrix organization, oxidation-reduction process, and 
      lung vasculature development. In the PPI network, 3 upregulated and 4 
      downregulated genes could be considered hub genes, which were confirmed in the 
      IPF cell models. CONCLUSION: Our study identified several IPF-related DEGs that 
      could become potential biomarkers for IPF. Large-scale multicentric studies are 
      eagerly needed to confirm the utility of these biomarkers.

AB  - The airway epithelium serves as the interface between the host and external 
      environment. In many chronic lung diseases, the airway is the site of substantial 
      remodeling after injury. While, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has 
      traditionally been considered a disease of the alveolus and lung matrix, the 
      dominant environmental (cigarette smoking) and genetic (gain of function MUC5B 
      promoter variant) risk factor primarily affect the distal airway epithelium. 
      Moreover, airway-specific pathogenic features of IPF include bronchiolization of 
      the distal airspace with abnormal airway cell-types and honeycomb cystic terminal 
      airway-like structures with concurrent loss of terminal bronchioles in regions of 
      minimal fibrosis. However, the pathogenic role of the airway epithelium in IPF is 
      unknown. Combining biophysical, genetic, and signaling analyses of primary airway 
      epithelial cells, we demonstrate that healthy and IPF airway epithelia are 
      biophysically distinct, identifying pathologic activation of the ERBB-YAP axis as 
      a specific and modifiable driver of prolongation of the unjammed-to-jammed 
      transition in IPF epithelia. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this biophysical 
      state and signaling axis correlates with epithelial-driven activation of the 
      underlying mesenchyme. Our data illustrate the active mechanisms regulating 
      airway epithelial-driven fibrosis and identify targets to modulate disease 
      progression.

LID - 704222
AB  - Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a serious lung disease which can result from known 
      genetic or environmental exposures but is more commonly idiopathic (IPF). In 
      familial PF (FPF), the majority of identified causal genes play key roles in the 
      maintenance of telomeres, the protective end structures of chromosomes. Recent 
      evidence suggests that short telomeres may also be implicated causally in a 
      significant proportion of idiopathic cases. The possible involvement of herpes 
      viruses in PF disease incidence and progression has been examined for many years, 
      with some studies showing strong, statistically significant associations and 
      others reporting no involvement. Evidence is thus polarized and remains 
      inconclusive. Here we review the reported involvement of herpes viruses in PF in 
      both animals and humans and present a summary of the evidence to date. We also 
      present several possible mechanisms of action of the different herpes viruses in 
      PF pathogenesis, including potential contributions to telomere attrition and 
      cellular senescence. Evidence for antiviral treatment in PF is very limited but 
      suggests a potential benefit. Further work is required to definitely answer the 
      question of whether herpes viruses impact PF disease onset and progression and to 
      enable the possible use of targeted antiviral treatments to improve clinical 
      outcomes.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a devastating, fibroproliferative, chronic 
      lung disorder, is associated with expansion of fibroblasts/myofibroblasts, which 
      leads to excessive production and deposition of extracellular matrix. IPF is 
      typically clinically identified as end-stage lung disease, after fibrotic 
      processes are well-established and advanced. Fibroblasts have been shown to be 
      critically important in the development and progression of IPF. We hypothesize 
      that differential chromatin access can drive genetic differences in IPF 
      fibroblasts relative to healthy fibroblasts. To this end, we performed assay of 
      transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing to identify differentially accessible 
      regions within the genomes of fibroblasts from healthy and IPF lungs. Multiple 
      motifs were identified to be enriched in IPF fibroblasts compared with healthy 
      fibroblasts, including binding motifs for TWIST1 and FOXA1. RNA sequencing 
      identified 93 genes that could be annotated to differentially accessible regions. 
      Pathway analysis of the annotated genes identified cellular adhesion, 
      cytoskeletal anchoring, and cell differentiation as important biological 
      processes. In addition, single nucleotide polymorphism analysis showed that 
      linkage disequilibrium blocks of IPF risk single nucleotide polymorphisms with 
      IPF-accessible regions that have been identified to be located in genes that are 
      important in IPF, including MUC5B, TERT, and TOLLIP. Validation studies in 
      isolated lung tissue confirmed increased expression for TWIST1 and FOXA1 in 
      addition to revealing SHANK2 and CSPR2 as novel targets. Thus, modulation of 
      differential chromatin access may be an important mechanism in the pathogenesis 
      of lung fibrosis.

TI  - Inhibition of DNA methylation de-represses peroxisome proliferator-activated 
      receptor-gamma and attenuates pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 1304-1318
LID - 10.1111/bph.15655 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Development of pulmonary fibrosis is associated with 
      altered DNA methylation modifications of fibrogenic gene expression. However, 
      their causal relationships and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This 
      study investigates the critical role of DNA methylation aberration-associated 
      suppression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) in pulmonary 
      fibrosis. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Expression of PPARgamma and bioactive DNA 
      methyltransferases (DNMTs) and PPARgamma promoter methylation status were examined in 
      fibrotic lungs of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients and bleomycin 
      (Blm)-treated mice. DNA demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5aza) and 
      glycyrrhizic acid (GA) derived from medicinal plant were assessed for their PPARgamma 
      de-repression and anti-pulmonary fibrosis activities. PPARgamma knockout mice were 
      created to determine the critical role of PPARgamma in this protection. KEY RESULTS: 
      Lung PPARgamma expression was markedly suppressed in IPF patients and Blm mice, 
      accompanied by increased DNMT 1/DNMT3a and PPARgamma promoter hypermethylation. 
      Administration of 5-aza and GA similarly demethylated PPARgamma promoter, restored 
      PPARgamma loss and alleviated fibrotic lung pathologies, including structural 
      alterations and adverse expression of fibrotic mediators and inflammatory 
      cytokines. In cultured lung fibroblasts and alveolar epithelial cells, GA 
      alleviated PPARgamma-mediated suppression of fibrosis in a gain of DNMT-sensitive 
      manner, and in PPARgamma knockout mice, the anti-fibrotic effects of 5aza and GA were 
      significantly reduced, suggesting that PPARgamma is a critical mediator of epigenetic 
      pulmonary fibrogenesis. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Aberrant DNMT1/3a elevations 
      and the resultant PPARgamma suppression contribute significantly to the development 
      of pulmonary fibrosis, and strategies targeting DNMT/PPARgamma axis with synthetic or 
      natural compounds might benefit patients with pulmonary fibrotic disorders.

TI  - Restoration of SIRT3 gene expression by airway delivery resolves age-associated 
      persistent lung fibrosis in mice.
PG  - 205-217
LID - 10.1038/s43587-021-00027-5 [doi]
AB  - Aging is a risk factor for progressive fibrotic disorders involving diverse organ 
      systems, including the lung. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, an age-associated 
      degenerative lung disorder, is characterized by persistence of 
      apoptosis-resistant myofibroblasts. In this report, we demonstrate that sirtuin-3 
      (SIRT3), a mitochondrial deacetylase, is downregulated in lungs of IPF human 
      subjects and in mice subjected to lung injury. Over-expression of the SIRT3 cDNA 
      via airway delivery restored capacity for fibrosis resolution in aged mice, in 
      association with activation of the forkhead box transcription factor, FoxO3a, in 
      fibroblasts, upregulation of pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, and 
      recovery of apoptosis susceptibility. While transforming growth factor-beta1 reduced 
      levels of SIRT3 and FoxO3a in lung fibroblasts, cell non-autonomous effects 
      involving macrophage secreted products were necessary for SIRT3-mediated 
      activation of FoxO3a. Together, these findings reveal a novel role of SIRT3 in 
      pro-resolution macrophage functions that restore susceptibility to apoptosis in 
      fibroblasts via a FoxO3a-dependent mechanism.

TI  - Inhibition of PDIA3 in club cells attenuates osteopontin production and lung 
      fibrosis.
PG  - 669-678
LID - 10.1136/thoraxjnl-2021-216882 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of club cells in the pathology of idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF) is not well understood. Protein disulfide isomerase A3 (PDIA3), an 
      endoplasmic reticulum-based redox chaperone required for the functions of various 
      fibrosis-related proteins; however, the mechanisms of action of PDIA3 in 
      pulmonary fibrosis are not fully elucidated. OBJECTIVES: To examine the role of 
      club cells and PDIA3 in the pathology of pulmonary fibrosis and the therapeutic 
      potential of inhibition of PDIA3 in lung fibrosis. METHODS: Role of PDIA3 and 
      aberrant club cells in lung fibrosis was studied by analyses of human 
      transcriptome dataset from Lung Genomics Research Consortium, other public 
      resources, the specific deletion or inhibition of PDIA3 in club cells and 
      blocking SPP1 downstream of PDIA3 in mice. RESULTS: PDIA3 and club cell secretory 
      protein (SCGB1A1) signatures are upregulated in IPF compared with control 
      patients. PDIA3 or SCGB1A1 increases also correlate with a decrease in lung 
      function in patients with IPF. The bleomycin (BLM) model of lung fibrosis showed 
      increases in PDIA3 in SCGB1A1 cells in the lung parenchyma. Ablation of Pdia3, 
      specifically in SCGB1A1 cells, decreases parenchymal SCGB1A1 cells along with 
      fibrosis in mice. The administration of a PDI inhibitor LOC14 reversed the 
      BLM-induced parenchymal SCGB1A1 cells and fibrosis in mice. Evaluation of PDIA3 
      partners revealed that SPP1 is a major interactor in fibrosis. Blocking SPP1 
      attenuated the development of lung fibrosis in mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our study 
      reveals a new relationship with distally localised club cells, PDIA3 and SPP1 in 
      lung fibrosis and inhibition of PDIA3 or SPP1 attenuates lung fibrosis.

TI  - Targeting Cpt1a-Bcl-2 interaction modulates apoptosis resistance and fibrotic 
      remodeling.

AB  - The mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) regulates metabolic reprogramming in 
      lung macrophages and the progression of pulmonary fibrosis. Fibrosis progression 
      is associated with apoptosis resistance in lung macrophages; however, the 
      mechanism(s) by which apoptosis resistance occurs is poorly understood. Here, we 
      found a marked increase in mitochondrial B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) in lung 
      macrophages from subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Similar 
      findings were seen in bleomycin-injured wild-type (WT) mice, whereas Bcl-2 was 
      markedly decreased in mice expressing a dominant-negative mitochondrial calcium 
      uniporter (DN-MCU). Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (Cpt1a), the rate-limiting 
      enzyme for fatty acid beta-oxidation, directly interacted with Bcl-2 by binding to 
      its BH3 domain, which anchored Bcl-2 in the mitochondria to attenuate apoptosis. 
      This interaction was dependent on Cpt1a activity. Lung macrophages from IPF 
      subjects had a direct correlation between CPT1A and Bcl-2, whereas the absence of 
      binding induced apoptosis. The deletion of Bcl-2 in macrophages protected mice 
      from developing pulmonary fibrosis. Moreover, mice had resolution when Bcl-2 was 
      deleted or was inhibited with ABT-199 after fibrosis was established. These 
      observations implicate an interplay between macrophage fatty acid beta-oxidation, 
      apoptosis resistance, and dysregulated fibrotic remodeling.

AB  - While epithelial-fibroblast interactions are viewed as the primary drivers of 
      Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), evidence gleaned from animal modeling and 
      human studies implicates innate immunity as well. To provide perspective on this 
      topic, this review synthesizes the available data regarding the complex role of 
      innate immunity in IPF. The role of substances present in the fibrotic 
      microenvironment including pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) derived 
      from invading or commensal microbes, and danger associated molecular patterns 
      (DAMPs) derived from injured cells and tissues will be discussed along with the 
      proposed contribution of innate immune populations such as macrophages, 
      neutrophils, fibrocytes, myeloid suppressor cells, and innate lymphoid cells. 
      Each component will be considered in the context of its relationship to 
      environmental and genetic factors, disease outcomes, and potential therapies. We 
      conclude with discussion of unanswered questions and opportunities for future 
      study in this area.

TI  - Fibrotic Idiopathic Interstitial Lung Disease: The Molecular and Cellular Key 
      Players.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22168952 [doi]
LID - 8952
AB  - Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) that are known as diffuse parenchymal lung 
      diseases (DPLDs) lead to the damage of alveolar epithelium and lung parenchyma, 
      culminating in inflammation and widespread fibrosis. ILDs that account for more 
      than 200 different pathologies can be divided into two groups: ILDs that have a 
      known cause and those where the cause is unknown, classified as idiopathic 
      interstitial pneumonia (IIP). IIPs include idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), 
      non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), cryptogenic organizing pneumonia 
      (COP) known also as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), acute 
      interstitial pneumonia (AIP), desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP), 
      respiratory bronchiolitis-associated interstitial lung disease (RB-ILD), and 
      lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP). In this review, our aim is to describe 
      the pathogenic mechanisms that lead to the onset and progression of the different 
      IIPs, starting from IPF as the most studied, in order to find both the common and 
      standalone molecular and cellular key players among them. Finally, a deeper 
      molecular and cellular characterization of different interstitial lung diseases 
      without a known cause would contribute to giving a more accurate diagnosis to the 
      patients, which would translate to a more effective treatment decision.

AB  - Alveolar epithelial type 2 cell (AEC2) dysfunction is implicated in the 
      pathogenesis of adult and pediatric interstitial lung disease (ILD), including 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF); however, identification of 
      disease-initiating mechanisms has been impeded by inability to access primary 
      AEC2s early on. Here, we present a human in vitro model permitting investigation 
      of epithelial-intrinsic events culminating in AEC2 dysfunction, using 
      patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) carrying an 
      AEC2-exclusive disease-associated variant (SFTPC(I73T)). Comparing syngeneic 
      mutant versus gene-corrected iPSCs after differentiation into AEC2s (iAEC2s), we 
      find that mutant iAEC2s accumulate large amounts of misprocessed and 
      mistrafficked pro-SFTPC protein, similar to in vivo changes, resulting in 
      diminished AEC2 progenitor capacity, perturbed proteostasis, altered bioenergetic 
      programs, time-dependent metabolic reprogramming, and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) 
      pathway activation. Treatment of SFTPC(I73T)-expressing iAEC2s with 
      hydroxychloroquine, a medication used in pediatric ILD, aggravates the observed 
      perturbations. Thus, iAEC2s provide a patient-specific preclinical platform for 
      modeling the epithelial-intrinsic dysfunction at ILD inception.

AB  - Although aberrant alveolar myofibroblasts (AMYFs) proliferation and 
      differentiation are often associated with abnormal lung development and diseases, 
      such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
      (COPD), and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), epigenetic mechanisms regulating 
      proliferation and differentiation of AMYFs remain poorly understood. Protein 
      arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7) is the only reported type III enzyme 
      responsible for monomethylation of arginine residue on both histone and 
      nonhistone substrates. Here we provide evidence for PRMT7's function in 
      regulating AMYFs proliferation and differentiation during lung alveologenesis. In 
      PRMT7-deficient mice, we found reduced AMYFs proliferation and differentiation, 
      abnormal elastin deposition, and failure of alveolar septum formation. We further 
      shown that oncogene forkhead box M1 (Foxm1) is a direct target of PRMT7 and that 
      PRMT7-catalyzed monomethylation at histone H4 arginine 3 (H4R3me1) directly 
      associate with chromatin of Foxm1 to activate its transcription, and thereby 
      regulate of cell cycle-related genes to inhibit AMYFs proliferation and 
      differentiation. Overexpression of Foxm1 in isolated myofibroblasts (MYFs) 
      significantly rescued PRMT7-deficiency-induced cell proliferation and 
      differentiation defects. Thus, our results reveal a novel epigenetic mechanism 
      through which PRMT7-mediated histone arginine monomethylation activates Foxm1 
      transcriptional expression to regulate AMYFs proliferation and differentiation 
      during lung alveologenesis and may represent a potential target for intervention 
      in pulmonary diseases.

      fibrosis.
LID - e152503 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/jci.insight.152503 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal fibrotic lung disease associated 
      with unremitting fibroblast activation including fibroblast-to-myofibroblast 
      transformation (FMT), migration, resistance to apoptotic clearance, and excessive 
      deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in the distal lung parenchyma. 
      Aberrant activation of lung-developmental pathways is associated with severe 
      fibrotic lung disease; however, the mechanisms through which these pathways 
      activate fibroblasts in IPF remain unclear. Sry-box transcription factor 9 (Sox9) 
      is a member of the high-mobility group box family of DNA-binding transcription 
      factors that are selectively expressed by epithelial cell progenitors to modulate 
      branching morphogenesis during lung development. We demonstrate that Sox9 is 
      upregulated via MAPK/PI3K-dependent signaling and by the transcription factor 
      Wilms' tumor 1 in distal lung-resident fibroblasts in IPF. Mechanistically, using 
      fibroblast activation assays, we demonstrate that Sox9 functions as a positive 
      regulator of FMT, migration, survival, and ECM production. Importantly, our in 
      vivo studies demonstrate that fibroblast-specific deletion of Sox9 is sufficient 
      to attenuate collagen deposition and improve lung function during TGF-alpha-induced 
      pulmonary fibrosis. Using a mouse model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, 
      we show that myofibroblast-specific Sox9 overexpression augments fibroblast 
      activation and pulmonary fibrosis. Thus, Sox9 functions as a profibrotic 
      transcription factor in activating fibroblasts, illustrating the potential 
      utility of targeting Sox9 in IPF treatment.

TI  - Integrated analysis of the molecular mechanisms in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 3412-3424
LID - 10.7150/ijms.61309 [doi]
AB  - Rationale: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is one of the most aggressive 
      forms of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. Some miRNAs may be associated with 
      IPF and may affect the occurrence and development of IPF in various pathways. 
      Many miRNAs and genes that may be involved in the development of IPF have been 
      discovered using chip and high throughput technologies. Methods: We analyzed one 
      miRNA and four mRNA databases. We identified hub genes and pathways related to 
      IPF using GO, KEGG enrichment analysis, gene set variation analysis (GSVA), PPI 
      network construction, and hub gene analysis. A comprehensive analysis of 
      differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs), predicted miRNA target genes, and 
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs) led to the creation of a miRNA-mRNA 
      regulatory network in IPF. Results: We found 203 DEGs and 165 DEMs that were 
      associated with IPF. The findings of enrichment analyses showed that these DEGs 
      were mainly involved in antimicrobial humoral response, antimicrobial humoral 
      immune response mediated by antimicrobial peptide, extracellular matrix 
      organization, cell killing, and organ or tissue specific immune response. The 
      VEGFA, CDH5, and WNT3A genes overlapped between hub genes and the miRNA-mRNA 
      regulatory network. The miRNAs including miR-199b-5p, miR-140-5p, miR-199a-5p, 
      miR-125A-5p, and miR-107 that we predicted would regulate the VEGFA, CDH5, and 
      WNT3A genes, which were also associated with IPF or other fibrosis-related 
      diseases. GSVA indicated that metabolic processes of UTP and IMP, immune 
      response, regulation of Th2 cell cytokine production, and positive regulation of 
      NK cell-mediated immunity are associated with the pathogenesis and treatment of 
      IPF. These pathways also interact with VEGFA, CDH5, and WNT3A. Conclusion: These 
      findings provide a new research direction for the diagnosis and treatment of IPF.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is one of the most common 
      idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, which can occur all over the world. The median 
      survival time of patients is about 3-5 years, and the mortality is relatively 
      high. OBJECTIVE: To reveal the potential molecular characteristics of IPF and 
      deepen the understanding of the molecular mechanism of IPF. In order to provide 
      some guidance for the clinical treatment, new drug development, and prognosis 
      judgment of IPF. Although the preliminary conclusion of this study has certain 
      guiding significance for the treatment of IPF and so on, it needs more accurate 
      analytical approaches and large sample clinical trials to verify. METHODS: 220 
      patients with IPF were divided into different subgroups according to the gene 
      expression profiles, which were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) 
      database. In addition, these subgroups present different expression forms and 
      clinical features. Therefore, weighted gene coexpression analysis (WGCNA) was 
      used to seek the differences between subtypes. And six subgroup-specific WGCNA 
      modules were identified. RESULTS: Combined with the characteristics of WGCNA and 
      KEGG enrichment modules, the autophagic pathway was only upregulated in subgroup 
      I and enriched significantly. The differentiation pathways of Th1 and Th2 cells 
      were only upregulated and enriched in subgroup II. At the same time, combined 
      with clinical information, IPF patients in subgroup II were older and more 
      serious, which may be closely related to the differentiation of Th1 and Th2 
      cells. In contrast, the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway and Ca(+) 
      signaling pathway were significantly upregulated and enriched in subgroup III. 
      Although there was no significant difference in prognosis between subgroup I and 
      subgroup III, their intrinsic biological characteristics were very different. 
      These results suggest that the subtypes may represent risk factors of age and 
      intrinsic biological characteristics and may also partly reflect the severity of 
      the disease. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, current studies have improved our 
      understanding of IPF-related molecular mechanisms. At the same time, because the 
      results show that patients from different subgroups may have their own unique 
      gene expression patterns, it reminds us that patients in each subgroup should 
      receive more personalized treatment.

TI  - Asporin Promotes TGF-beta-induced Lung Myofibroblast Differentiation by Facilitating 
      Rab11-Dependent Recycling of TbetaRI.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive fibrotic lung 
      disease with high mortality and morbidity. ASPN (asporin), a member of the small 
      leucine-rich proteoglycan family, plays crucial roles in tissue injury and 
      regeneration. However, the precise pathophysiological role of ASPN and its 
      molecular mechanisms in IPF remain unknown. We sought to investigate the role of 
      ASPN during the development of pulmonary fibrosis and the therapeutic potential 
      of targeting ASPN-related signaling pathways. In our study, three microarray 
      datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, and 
      differentially expressed genes were screened out by bioinformatic analysis. Hub 
      genes were selected from the protein-protein interaction network. ASPN was 
      examined in lung tissues from pulmonary fibrosis mouse models, and the role of 
      ASPN in transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta/Smad signaling was determined by 
      transfection with ASPN shRNA vectors in vitro. Biotinylation assays were 
      conducted to measure plasma membrane TFG-beta receptor I (TbetaRI) and TbetaRI recycling 
      after ASPN knockdown. The results showed ASPN expression was increased in the 
      lungs of pulmonary fibrosis mouse models, and ASPN was primarily localized in 
      alpha-SMA(+) myofibroblasts. In vitro experiments proved that ASPN knockdown 
      inhibited TGF-beta/Smad signaling and myofibroblast differentiation by regulating 
      the stability of TbetaRI. Further molecular mechanisms revealed that ASPN knockdown 
      inhibited TGF-beta/Smad signaling by suppressing recycling of TbetaRI to the cell 
      surface in a Rab11-dependent manner and facilitated lysosome-mediated degradation 
      of TbetaRI. In conclusion, our findings provide important evidence for the use of 
      ASPN as a novel pharmacological target for treating pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a direct consequence of cellular 
      endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and a key disease driving mechanism in IPF. The 
      resolution of the UPR is directed by PPP1R15A (GADD34) and leads to the 
      restoration of normal ribosomal activity. While the role of PPP1R15A has been 
      explored in lung epithelial cells, the role of this UPR resolving factor has yet 
      to be explored in lung mesenchymal cells. The objective of the current study was 
      to determine the expression and role of PPP1R15A in IPF fibroblasts and in a 
      bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis model. A survey of IPF lung tissue revealed that 
      PPP1R15A expression was markedly reduced. Targeting PPP1R15A in primary 
      fibroblasts modulated TGF-beta-induced fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation 
      and exacerbated pulmonary fibrosis in bleomycin-challenged mice. Interestingly, 
      the loss of PPP1R15A appeared to promote lung fibroblast senescence. Taken 
      together, our findings demonstrate the major role of PPP1R15A in the regulation 
      of lung mesenchymal cells, and regulation of PPP1R15A may represent a novel 
      therapeutic strategy in IPF.

      Patients.

LID - 11830
AB  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
      (IPF) are chronic, progressive lung ailments that are characterized by distinct 
      pathologies. Early detection biomarkers and disease mechanisms for these 
      debilitating diseases are lacking. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including 
      exosomes, are small, lipid-bound vesicles attributed to carry proteins, lipids, 
      and RNA molecules to facilitate cell-to-cell communication under normal and 
      diseased conditions. Exosomal miRNAs have been studied in relation to many 
      diseases. However, there is little to no knowledge regarding the miRNA population 
      of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) or the lung-tissue-derived exosomes in 
      COPD and IPF. Here, we determined and compared the miRNA profiles of BALF- and 
      lung-tissue-derived exosomes of healthy non-smokers, smokers, and patients with 
      COPD or IPF in independent cohorts. Results: Exosome characterization using 
      NanoSight particle tracking and TEM demonstrated that the BALF-derived exosomes 
      were ~89.85 nm in size with a yield of ~2.95 x 10(10) particles/mL in 
      concentration. Lung-derived exosomes were larger in size (~146.04 nm) with a 
      higher yield of ~2.38 x 10(11) particles/mL. NGS results identified three 
      differentially expressed miRNAs in the BALF, while there was one in the 
      lung-derived exosomes from COPD patients as compared to healthy non-smokers. Of 
      these, miR-122-5p was three- or five-fold downregulated among the 
      lung-tissue-derived exosomes of COPD patients as compared to healthy non-smokers 
      and smokers, respectively. Interestingly, there were a large number (55) of 
      differentially expressed miRNAs in the lung-tissue-derived exosomes of IPF 
      patients compared to non-smoking controls. Conclusions: Overall, we identified 
      lung-specific miRNAs associated with chronic lung diseases that can serve as 
      potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive 
      fibroproliferative disorder that has one of the poorest prognoses amongst 
      interstitial lung diseases. Recently, the finding of aberrant expression levels 
      of miRNAs in IPF patients has drawn significant attention to the involvement of 
      these molecules in the pathogenesis of this disease. Clarification of the 
      differential expression of miRNAs in health and disease may identify novel 
      therapeutic strategies that can be employed in the future to combat IPF. This 
      study evaluates the miRNA expression profiles in a sheep model for lung fibrosis 
      and compares them to the miRNA profiles of both IPF patients and the mouse 
      bleomycin model for pulmonary fibrosis. Pathway enrichment analyses were 
      performed on differentially expressed miRNAs to illustrate which biological 
      mechanisms were associated with lung fibrosis. RESULTS: We discovered 49 
      differentially expressed miRNAs in the sheep fibrosis model, in which 32 miRNAs 
      were significantly down regulated, while 17 miRNAs were significantly upregulated 
      due to bleomycin-induced lung injury. Moreover, the miRNA families miR-29, 
      miR-26, miR-30, let-7, miR-21, miR-19, miR-17 and miR-199 were aberrantly 
      expressed in both sheep and mouse models, with similar differential miRNAs 
      expression observed in IPF cases. Importantly, 18 miRNAs were aberrantly 
      expressed in both the sheep model and IPF patients, but not in mice. CONCLUSION: 
      Together with pathway enrichment analyses, these results show that the sheep 
      model can potentially be used to characterize previously unrecognized biological 
      pathways associated with lung fibrosis.

AB  - The pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) involves a complex 
      interplay of cell types and signaling pathways. Recurrent alveolar epithelial 
      cell (AEC) injury may occur in the context of predisposing factors (e.g., 
      genetic, environmental, epigenetic, immunologic, and gerontologic), leading to 
      metabolic dysfunction, senescence, aberrant epithelial cell activation, and 
      dysregulated epithelial repair. The dysregulated epithelial cell interacts with 
      mesenchymal, immune, and endothelial cells via multiple signaling mechanisms to 
      trigger fibroblast and myofibroblast activation. Recent single-cell RNA 
      sequencing studies of IPF lungs support the epithelial injury model. These 
      studies have uncovered a novel type of AEC with characteristics of an aberrant 
      basal cell, which may disrupt normal epithelial repair and propagate a 
      profibrotic phenotype. Here, we review the pathogenesis of IPF in the context of 
      novel bioinformatics tools as strategies to discover pathways of disease, 
      cell-specific mechanisms, and cell-cell interactions that propagate the 
      profibrotic niche.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an 
      interstitial lung disease with unknown etiology. Oxytropis falcata Bunge (O. 
      falcata) is a 1-35 cm high perennial clustered herb, also known as edaxia, has 
      viscosity and a special smell, and is mainly distributed in the western areas of 
      China. The root of O. falcata has a diameter of 6 mm, is straight and deep, dark 
      red and its stems are shortened, woody and multibranched. O. falcata has 
      heat-clearing, detoxification, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, 
      hemostatic and antitumor activities. Furthermore, O. falcata has excellent 
      anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects, and it is one of the three major 
      anti-inflammatory drugs in Tibetan medicine, known as "the king of herbs". Total 
      flavonoids of Oxytropis falcata Bunge (FOFB) were previously extracted, and their 
      pharmacological activities are consistent with those of the whole herb. In this 
      study, FOFB was extracted from O. falcata by ethanol extraction, and the 
      mechanism of FOFB on IPF was verified by in vivo and in vitro experiments. AIM OF 
      THE STUDY: In this study, we aimed to observe the effects of FOFB on idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In in vivo experiments, an IPF rat 
      model was established by bleomycin induction. The rats were treated with FOFB 
      (100, 200, 400 mg kg(-1).d(-1)) for 4 weeks. Masson staining and the expression 
      of TGF-beta, p-Smad2, p-Smad3 and Smad7 in the lung tissue of rats were detected. In 
      in vitro experiments, we perfused normal rats with FOFB (100, 200, 
      400 mg kg(-1).d(-1)) and obtained the corresponding drug-containing serum. The 
      HFL-1 cell model induced by TGF-beta1 was used to detect the corresponding indices 
      through intervention with drug-containing serum. The best intervention time for 
      drug-containing serum was detected by the CCK-8 method. Changes in apoptosis, 
      cytoskeleton and rough endoplasmic reticulum structure were detected. Finally, 
      the expression of TGF-beta, p-Smad2, p-Smad3 and Smad7 in cells was examined. 
      RESULTS: In vivo, Masson staining indicated that the degree of pulmonary fibrosis 
      increased significantly, the expression of TGF-beta, p-smad2 and p-Smad3 increased 
      significantly, and the expression of Smad7 decreased in the model group. We found 
      that the degree of pulmonary fibrosis gradually decreased and that the inhibition 
      of the TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathway became more obvious with increasing FOFB 
      dose. FOFB (400 mg kg(-1).d(-1)) significantly improved the degree of pulmonary 
      fibrosis in rats. In in vitro experiments, the CCK-8 results showed that 120 h 
      was the best intervention time for drug-containing serum. In the model group, 
      there was no obvious apoptosis or changes in microfilaments and microtubules, the 
      number of rough endoplasmic reticulum increased, and the expression of TGF-beta, 
      p-Smad2 and p-Smad3 increased significantly, while the expression of Smad7 
      decreased significantly. We found that with the increase in drug-containing serum 
      concentration, the apoptosis, cytoskeleton and degree of destruction of the rough 
      endoplasmic reticulum in the HFL-1 cell model also increased, and the inhibition 
      of the TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathway became more pronounced; the effect of the 
      drug-containing serum administered with FOFB (400 mg kg(-1).d(-1)) was the most 
      significant. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that FOFB can improve the 
      occurrence and development of IPF. The effect of FOFB on IPF may be mediated by 
      inhibition of the TGF-beta1/Smad signaling pathway.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive, fibrosing 
      interstitial lung disease (ILD) of unknown aetiology, with a median survival of 
      2-4 years from the time of diagnosis. Although IPF has unknown aetiology by 
      definition, there have been identified several risks factors increasing the 
      probability of the onset and progression of the disease in IPF patients such as 
      cigarette smoking and environmental risk factors associated with domestic and 
      occupational exposure. Among them, cigarette smoking together with concomitant 
      emphysema might predispose IPF patients to lung cancer (LC), mostly to non-small 
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC), increasing the risk of lung cancer development. To this 
      purpose, IPF and LC share several cellular and molecular processes driving the 
      progression of both pathologies such as fibroblast transition proliferation and 
      activation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, oxidative stress, and many genetic and 
      epigenetic markers that predispose IPF patients to LC development. Nintedanib, a 
      tyrosine-kinase inhibitor, was firstly developed as an anticancer drug and then 
      recognized as an anti-fibrotic agent based on the common target molecular 
      pathway. In this review our aim is to describe the updated studies on common 
      cellular and molecular mechanisms between IPF and lung cancer, knowledge of which 
      might help to find novel therapeutic targets for this disease combination.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal lung disease of 
      unknown etiology. Immune disorders play an important role in IPF pathogenesis. 
      Here, we show that Th9 cells differentiate and activate in the lung tissue of 
      patients with IPF and bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung fibrosis mice. Moreover, we 
      found that Th9 cells promote pulmonary fibrosis in two ways. On the one hand, Th9 
      cells promote fibroblast differentiation, activation, and collagen secretion by 
      secreting IL-9. On the other hand, they promote differentiation of Th0 cells into 
      Th2 cells by secreting IL-4. Th9 cells and Th2 cells can promote each other, 
      accelerating the Th1/Th2 imbalance and eventually forming a positive feedback of 
      pulmonary fibrosis. In addition, we found that neutralizing IL-9 in both 
      preventive and therapeutic settings ameliorates bleomycin-induced pulmonary 
      fibrosis. Furthermore, we identified several critical signaling pathways involved 
      in the effect of neutralizing IL-9 on pulmonary fibrosis by proteomics study. 
      From an immunological perspective, we elucidated the novel role and underlying 
      mechanism of Th9 cells in pulmonary fibrosis. Our study suggested that Th9-based 
      immunotherapy may be employed as a treatment strategy for IPF.

LID - 739810
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is an age-dependent progressive and fatal lung 
      disease of unknown etiology, which is characterized by the excessive accumulation 
      of extracellular matrix inside the interstitial layer of the lung parenchyma that 
      leads to abnormal scar architecture and compromised lung function capacity. 
      Recent genetic studies have attributed the pathological genes or genetic 
      mutations associated with familial idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and 
      sporadic IPF to telomere-related components, suggesting that telomere dysfunction 
      is an important determinant of this disease. In this study, we summarized recent 
      advances in our understanding of how telomere dysfunction drives IPF genesis. We 
      highlighted the key role of alveolar stem cell dysfunction caused by telomere 
      shortening or telomere uncapping, which bridged the gap between telomere 
      abnormalities and fibrotic lung pathology. We emphasized that 
      senescence-associated secretory phenotypes, innate immune cell infiltration, 
      and/or inflammation downstream of lung stem cell dysfunction influenced the 
      native microenvironment and local cell signals, including increased transforming 
      growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling in the lung, to induce pro-fibrotic 
      conditions. In addition, the failed regeneration of new alveoli due to alveolar 
      stem cell dysfunction might expose lung cells to elevated mechanical tension, 
      which could activate the TGF-beta signaling loop to promote the fibrotic process, 
      especially in a periphery-to-center pattern as seen in IPF patients. 
      Understanding the telomere-related molecular and pathophysiological mechanisms of 
      IPF would provide new insights into IPF etiology and therapeutic strategies for 
      this fatal disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lung disease involving 
      chronic progressive fibrosis, with unclear pathogenesis. In recent years, people 
      have paid increasing attention to the role of immune mechanism. In this study, 
      bioinformatics analysis was used to determine the potential immune-related 
      biomarkers for the diagnosis of IPF, and further analyze the role of immune cell 
      infiltration in the pathogenesis of IPF. METHODS: The IPF data set (GSE150910) 
      was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. We used R 
      software to screen differential immune-related genes (IRGs). Least absolute 
      shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, random forest algorithm, and 
      support vector machine (SVM) were used to screen and determine IPF IRGs to be 
      diagnostic biomarkers. The GSE32537 and GSE10667 data sets were combined into 1 
      data set to verify the diagnostic efficacy of biomarkers. Cell-type 
      Identification by Estimating Relative Subsets of RNA Transcripts (CIBERSORT) was 
      used to evaluate the infiltration of immune cells in IPF tissues, and analyze the 
      relationship between diagnostic markers and immune cell infiltration. Meanwhile, 
      clinical specimens were used to verify the diagnostic efficacy of biomarkers and 
      their relationship with immune cell infiltration. RESULTS: In this study, 408 
      participants were involved in the screening to find that PLXNA4 and SLIT2 can be 
      used as diagnostic biomarkers of IPF, and the results were verified by clinical 
      samples. Immune cell infiltration analysis found that regulatory T cells (Tregs), 
      memory B cells, plasma cells, and eosinophils might be involved in the process of 
      IPF. In addition, Tregs were most closely related to PLXNA4 and SLIT2. In 
      clinical samples, forkhead box p3 (FOXP3), a specific marker of Tregs, was 
      positively correlated with PLXNA4 and negatively correlated with SLIT2, which is 
      consistent with the results of bioinformatics analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The genes 
      PLXNA4 and SLIT2 can be used as diagnostic markers of IPF, and immune cell 
      infiltration plays an important role in the occurrence and development of IPF.

AB  - Patients with diabetes are over-represented among the total cases reported with 
      "idiopathic" pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). This raises the question, whether this is 
      an association only or whether diabetes itself can cause pulmonary fibrosis. 
      Recent studies in mouse models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes demonstrated that 
      diabetes causes pulmonary fibrosis. Both types of diabetes trigger a cascade, 
      starting with increased DNA damage, an impaired DNA repair, and leading to 
      persistent DNA damage signaling. This response, in turn, induces senescence, a 
      senescence-associated-secretory phenotype (SASP), marked by the release of 
      pro-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors, finally resulting in fibrosis. 
      Restoring DNA repair drives fibrosis into remission, thus proving causality. 
      These data can be translated clinically to patients with type 2 diabetes, 
      characterized by long-term diabetes and albuminuria. Hence there are several 
      arguments, to substitute the term "idiopathic" pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in 
      patients with diabetes (and exclusion of other causes of lung diseases) by the 
      term "diabetes-induced pulmonary fibrosis" (DiPF). However, future studies are 
      required to establish this term and to study whether patients with diabetes 
      respond to the established therapies similar to non-diabetic patients.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fibrotic lung disease with 
      an unmet need of biomarkers that can aid in the diagnostic and prognostic 
      assessment of the disease and response to treatment. In this two-part explorative 
      proteomic study, we demonstrate how proteins associated with tissue remodeling, 
      inflammation and chemotaxis such as MMP7, CXCL13 and CCL19 are released in 
      response to aberrant extracellular matrix (ECM) in IPF lung. We used a novel ex 
      vivo model where decellularized lung tissue from IPF patients and healthy donors 
      were repopulated with healthy fibroblasts to monitor locally released mediators. 
      Results were validated in longitudinally collected serum samples from 38 IPF 
      patients and from 77 healthy controls. We demonstrate how proteins elevated in 
      the ex vivo model (e.g., MMP7), and other serum proteins found elevated in IPF 
      patients such as HGF, VEGFA, MCP-3, IL-6 and TNFRSF12A, are associated with 
      disease severity and progression and their response to antifibrotic treatment. 
      Our study supports the model's applicability in studying mechanisms involved in 
      IPF and provides additional evidence for both established and potentially new 
      biomarkers in IPF.

AB  - Relaxin/insulin-like family peptide receptor 1 (RXFP1) mediates relaxin's 
      antifibrotic effects and has reduced expression in the lung and skin of patients 
      with fibrotic interstitial lung disease (fILD) including idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF) and systemic sclerosis (SSc). This may explain the failure of 
      relaxin-based anti-fibrotic treatments in SSc, but the regulatory mechanisms 
      controlling RXFP1 expression remain largely unknown. This study aimed to identify 
      regulatory elements of RXFP1 that may function differentially in fibrotic 
      fibroblasts. We identified and evaluated a distal regulatory region of RXFP1 in 
      lung fibroblasts using a luciferase reporter system. Using serial deletions, an 
      enhancer upregulating pGL3-promoter activity was localized to the distal region 
      between -584 to -242bp from the distal transcription start site (TSS). This 
      enhancer exhibited reduced activity in IPF and SSc lung fibroblasts. 
      Bioinformatic analysis identified two clusters of activator protein 1 (AP-1) 
      transcription factor binding sites within the enhancer. Site-directed mutagenesis 
      of the binding sites confirmed that only one cluster reduced activity (-358 to 
      -353 relative to distal TSS). Co-expression of FOS in lung fibroblasts further 
      increased enhancer activity. In vitro complex formation with a labeled probe 
      spanning the functional AP-1 site using nuclear proteins isolated from lung 
      fibroblasts confirmed a specific DNA/protein complex formation. Application of 
      antibodies against JUN and FOS resulted in the complex alteration, while 
      antibodies to JUNB and FOSL1 did not. Analysis of AP-1 binding in 5 pairs of 
      control and IPF lung fibroblasts detected positive binding more frequently in 
      control fibroblasts. Expression of JUN and FOS was reduced and correlated 
      positively with RXFP1 expression in IPF lungs. In conclusion, we identified a 
      distal enhancer of RXFP1 with differential activity in fibrotic lung fibroblasts 
      involving AP-1 transcription factors. Our study provides insight into RXFP1 
      downregulation in fILD and may support efforts to reevaluate relaxin-based 
      therapeutics alongside upregulation of RXFP1 transcription.

AB  - BACKGROUND: With the rapid advances of genetic and genomic technologies, the 
      pathophysiological mechanisms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) were 
      gradually becoming clear, however, the prognosis of IPF was still poor. This 
      study aimed to systematically explore the ferroptosis-related genes model 
      associated with prognosis in IPF patients. METHODS: Datasets were collected from 
      the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The least absolute shrinkage and selection 
      operator (LASSO) Cox regression analysis was applied to create a multi-gene 
      predicted model from patients with IPF in the Freiburg cohort of the GSE70866 
      dataset. The Siena cohort and the Leuven cohort were used for validation. 
      RESULTS: Nineteen differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the patients with 
      IPF and control were associated with poor prognosis based on the univariate Cox 
      regression analysis (all P < 0.05). According to the median value of the risk 
      score derived from an 8-ferroptosis-related genes signature, the three cohorts' 
      patients were stratified into two risk groups. Prognosis of high-risk group (high 
      risk score) was significantly poorer compared with low-risk group in the three 
      cohorts. According to multivariate Cox regression analyses, the risk score was an 
      independently predictor for poor prognosis in the three cohorts. Receiver 
      operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and decision curve analysis (DCA) 
      confirmed the signature's predictive value in the three cohorts. According to 
      functional analysis, inflammation- and immune-related pathways and biological 
      process could participate in the progression of IPF. CONCLUSIONS: These results 
      imply that the 8-ferroptosis-related genes signature in the bronchoalveolar 
      lavage samples might be an effective model to predict the poor prognosis of IPF.

      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are poorly understood. To understand the gene 
      expression patterns of the AEs of IPF, we studied gene expression profiling of 
      AEs of IPF. METHODS: The GEO datasets included in this study are GSE44723 and 
      GSE10667, and in-house RNA-seq data were used. DEG analysis used the limma 
      package, and the STRING database was used to construct the protein-protein 
      interaction (PPI) network, and its functional role was investigated through gene 
      ontology analysis. RESULTS: The results of DEG analysis indicated 76 upregulated 
      and 135 downregulated genes associated with an AE of IPF compared to stable IPF. 
      The PPI network included three core modules containing 24 of the 211 DEGs. Eleven 
      upregulated and six downregulated genes were evident in AEs of IPF compared with 
      stable IPF after validation. The upregulated genes were associated with cell 
      division. The downregulated genes were related to skeletal muscle differentiation 
      and development. CONCLUSION: In previous studies, 17 genes were strongly 
      associated with cell proliferation in various cell types. In particular, cyclin 
      A2 (CCNA2) was overexpressed in the alveolar epithelium of the lungs presenting 
      AEs of IPF. Aside from the previously described CCNA2, this study reveals 16 
      genes associated with AEs of IPF. This data could indicate new therapeutic 
      targets and potential biomarkers for the AEs of IPF.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal lung disease with unknown 
      etiological factors that can progress to other dangerous diseases like lung 
      cancer. Environmental and genetic predisposition are the two major etiological or 
      risk factors involved in the pathology of the IPF. Among the environmental risk 
      factors, smoking is one of the major causes for the development of IPF. 
      Epigenetic pathways like nucleosomes remodeling, DNA methylation, histone 
      modifications and miRNA mediated genes play a crucial role in development of IPF. 
      Mutations in the genes make the epigenetic factors as important drug targets in 
      IPF. Transcriptional changes due to environmental factors are also involved in 
      the progression of IPF. The mutations in human telomerase reverse transcriptase 
      (hTERT) have shown decreased life expectancy in IPF patients. The TERT-gene is 
      highly expressed in chronic smokers and makes the role of epigenetics evident. 
      Drug like nintedanib acts through vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 
      (VEGFR), while drug pirfenidone acts through transforming growth factor (TGF), 
      which is useful in IPF. Gefitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of EGFR, is useful 
      as an anti-fibrosis agent in preclinical models. Newer drugs such as 
      Celgene-CC90001 and FibroGen-FG-3019 are currently under investigations acts 
      through the modulating epigenetic mechanisms. Thus, the study on epigenetics 
      opens a wide window for the discovery of newer drugs. This study provides an 
      elementary analysis of multiple regulators of epigenetics and their roles 
      associated with the pathology of IPF. Further, this review also includes 
      epigenetic drugs under development in preclinical and clinical stages.

AB  - Epigenetic responses due to environmental changes alter chromatin structure, 
      which in turn modifies the phenotype, gene expression profile, and activity of 
      each cell type that has a role in the pathophysiology of a disease. Pulmonary 
      diseases are one of the major causes of death in the world, including lung 
      cancer, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), chronic obstructive pulmonary 
      disease (COPD), pulmonary hypertension (PH), lung tuberculosis, pulmonary 
      embolism, and asthma. Several lines of evidence indicate that epigenetic 
      modifications may be one of the main factors to explain the increasing incidence 
      and prevalence of lung diseases including IPF and COPD. Interestingly, isolated 
      fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells from patients with pulmonary diseases such as 
      IPF and PH that were cultured ex vivo maintained the disease phenotype. The cells 
      often show a hyper-proliferative, apoptosis-resistant phenotype with increased 
      expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) and activated focal adhesions suggesting 
      the presence of an epigenetically imprinted phenotype. Moreover, many 
      abnormalities observed in molecular processes in IPF patients are shown to be 
      epigenetically regulated, such as innate immunity, cellular senescence, and 
      apoptotic cell death. DNA methylation, histone modification, and microRNA 
      regulation constitute the most common epigenetic modification mechanisms.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an interstitial lung disease characterized 
      by chronic progressive pulmonary fibrosis and a poor prognosis. Genetic studies, 
      including transcriptomic and proteomics, have provided new insight into revealing 
      mechanisms of IPF. Herein we provided a novel strategy to identify biomarkers by 
      integrative analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic profiles of IPF patients. We 
      examined the landscape of IPF patients' gene expression in the transcription and 
      translation phases and investigated the expression and functions of two new 
      potential biomarkers. Differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs were mainly enriched in 
      pathways associated with immune system activities and inflammatory responses, 
      while DE proteins are related to extracellular matrix production and wound 
      repair. The upregulated genes in both phases are associated with wound repair and 
      cell differentiation, while the downregulated genes in both phases are associated 
      with reduced immune activities and the damage of the alveolar tissues. On this 
      basis, we identified thirteen potential marker genes. Among them, we validated 
      the expression changes of butyrophilin-like 9 (BTNL9) and plasmolipin (PLLP) and 
      investigated their functional pathways in the IPF mechanism. Both genes are 
      downregulated in the tissues of IPF patients and Bleomycin-induced mice, and 
      co-expression analysis indicates that they have a protective effect by inhibiting 
      extracellular matrix production and promoting wound repair in alveolar epithelial 
      cells.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive interstitial lung disease 
      with increasing occurrence, high death rates, and unfavorable treatment regimens. 
      The pathogenesis underlying IPF is complex and the epigenetic contributions to 
      IPF are largely unknown. Recent studies have shown that DOT1L (Disruptor of 
      telomeric silencing-1 like), a histone H3K79 methyltransferase, contributes to 
      fibrosis response, but its role in IPF remains unclear. DOT1L, H3K79me3, and the 
      profibrotic proteins levels were upregulated in the pulmonary fibrosis models 
      both in vivo and in vitro. Lentivirus-mediated DOT1L knockdown or DOT1L-specific 
      inhibitor EPZ5676 alleviated the pathogenesis of bleomycin-induced mouse 
      pulmonary fibrosis. Furthermore, heterozygous DOT1L-deficient mice (Dot1l(+/-)) 
      showed less sensitive to pulmonary fibrosis, as shown by decreased lung fibrosis 
      phenotypes in vivo. Mechanically, DOT1L regulated TGF-beta1-induced fibroblasts 
      fibrosis by increasing enrichments of H3K79me3 on the promoter of Jag1 gene 
      (encoding the Notch ligand Jagged1), enhancing the expression of Jagged1, which 
      in turn stimulated exuberant Notch signaling and actuated the fibrosis response. 
      In conclusion, our study confirmed DOT1L to be an epigenetic modifier in the

AB  - Pathological fibrosis contributes to progression of various diseases, for which 
      the therapeutic options are limited. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is one 
      such progressive and fatal interstitial fibrotic disease that is often 
      characterized by excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins 
      leading to stiff lung tissue and impaired gas exchange. However, the molecular 
      mechanisms underlying IPF progression remain largely unknown. In this study, we 
      determined the role of Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1), an 
      evolutionarily conserved transcription factor, in the differentiation of human 
      lung fibroblasts (HLFs) in vitro and in an animal model of bleomycin 
      (BLM)-induced lung fibrosis. We observed that the expression of RUNX1 was 
      significantly increased in the lungs of BLM-injected mice as compared to 
      saline-treated mice. Furthermore, HLFs stimulated with transforming growth factor 
      beta (TGF-beta) showed significantly higher RUNX1 expression at both mRNA and protein 
      levels, and compartmentalization in the nucleus. Inhibition of RUNX1 in HLFs 
      (using siRNA) showed a significant reduction in the differentiation of 
      fibroblasts into myofibroblasts as evidenced by reduced expression of 
      alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), TGF-beta and ECM proteins such as fibronectin 1 
      (FN1), and collagen 1A1 (COL1A1). Mechanistic studies revealed that the increased 
      expression of RUNX1 in TGF-beta-stimulated lung fibroblasts is due to enhanced mRNA 
      stability of RUNX1 through selective interaction with the RNA-binding profibrotic 
      protein, human antigen R (HuR). Collectively, our data demonstrate that increased 
      expression of RUNX1 augments processes involved in lung fibrosis including the 
      differentiation of fibroblasts into collagen-synthesizing myofibroblasts. Our 
      study suggests that targeting RUNX1 could limit the progression of organ fibrosis 
      in diseases characterized by abnormal collagen deposition.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a group of chronic interstitial pulmonary 
      diseases characterized by an inexorable decline in lung function with limited 
      treatment options. The abnormal expression of transforming growth factor-beta 
      (TGF-beta) in profibrotic macrophages is linked to severe pulmonary fibrosis, but 
      the regulation mechanisms of TGF-beta expression are incompletely understood. We 
      found that decreased expression of E3 ubiquitin ligase Fbxw7 in peripheral blood 
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was significantly related to the severity of pulmonary 
      fibrosis in IPF patients. Fbxw7 is identified to be a crucial suppressing factor 
      for pulmonary fibrosis development and progression in a mouse model induced by 
      intratracheal bleomycin treatment. Myeloid cell-specific Fbxw7 deletion increases 
      pulmonary monocyte-macrophages accumulation in lung tissue, and eventually 
      promotes bleomycin-induced collagen deposition and progressive pulmonary 
      fibrosis. Notably, the expression of TGF-beta in profibrotic macrophages was 
      significantly upregulated in myeloid cell-specific Fbxw7 deletion mice after 
      bleomycin treatment. C-Jun has long been regarded as a critical transcription 
      factor of Tgfb1, we clarified that Fbxw7 inhibits the expression of TGF-beta in 
      profibrotic macrophages by interacting with c-Jun and mediating its K48-linked 
      ubiquitination and degradation. These findings provide insight into the role of 
      Fbxw7 in the regulation of macrophages during the pathogenesis of pulmonary 
      fibrosis.

TI  - Genotype-Phenotype Relationships in Inheritable Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis: A 
      Greek National Cohort Study.
PG  - 531-543
LID - 10.1159/000520657 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Monogenic and polygenic inheritances are evidenced for idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Pathogenic variations in surfactant protein-related 
      genes, telomere-related genes (TRGs), and a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the 
      promoter of MUC5B gene encoding mucin 5B (rs35705950 T risk allele) are reported. 
      This French-Greek collaborative study, Gen-Phen-Re-GreekS in inheritable IPF 
      (iIPF), aimed to investigate genetic components and patients' characteristics in 
      the Greek national IPF cohort with suspected heritability. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      150 patients with familial PF, personal-family extrapulmonary disease suggesting 
      short telomere syndrome, and/or young age IPF were analyzed. RESULTS: MUC5B 
      rs35705950 T risk allele was detected in 103 patients (90 heterozygous, 13 
      homozygous, allelic frequency of 39%), monoallelic TRG pathogenic variations in 
      19 patients (8 TERT, 5 TERC, 2 RTEL1, 2 PARN, 1 NOP10, and 1 NHP2), and biallelic 
      ABCA3 pathogenic variations in 3. Overlapping MUC5B rs35705950 T risk allele and 
      TRG pathogenic variations were shown in 11 patients (5 TERT, 3 TERC, 1 PARN, 1 
      NOP10, and 1 NHP2), MUC5B rs35705950 T risk allele, and biallelic ABCA3 
      pathogenic variations in 2. In 38 patients, neither MUC5B rs35705950 T risk 
      allele nor TRG pathogenic variations were detectable. Kaplan-Meier curves showed 
      differences in time-to-death (p = 0.025) where patients with MUC5B rs35705950 T 
      risk allele alone or in combination with TRG pathogenic variations presented 
      better prognosis. CONCLUSION: The Gen-Phen-Re-GreekS in iIPF identified multiple 
      and overlapping genetic components including the rarest, underlying disease's 
      genetic "richesse," complexity and heterogeneity. Time-to-death differences may 
      relate to diverse IPF pathogenetic mechanisms implicating "personalized" medical 
      care driven by genotypes in the near future.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sepsis is associated with high platelet turnover and elevated levels 
      of immature platelets. Changes in the platelet transcriptome and the specific 
      impact of immature platelets on the platelet transcriptome remain unclear. Thus, 
      this study sought to address whether and how elevated levels of immature 
      platelets affect the platelet transcriptome in patients with sepsis. METHODS: 
      Blood samples were obtained from patients with sepsis requiring vasopressor 
      therapy (n = 8) and from a control group of patients with stable coronary artery 
      disease and otherwise similar demographic characteristics (n = 8). Immature 
      platelet fraction (IPF) was determined on a Sysmex XE 2100 analyser and platelet 
      function was tested by impedance aggregometry. RNA from leukocyte-depleted 
      platelets was used for transcriptome analysis by Next Generation Sequencing 
      integrating the use of unique molecular identifiers. RESULTS: IPF (median 
      [interquartile range]) was significantly elevated in sepsis patients (6.4 
      [5.3-8.7] % vs. 3.6 [2.6-4.6] %, p = 0.005). Platelet function testing revealed 
      no differences in adenosine diphosphate- or thrombin receptor activating 
      peptide-induced platelet aggregation between control and sepsis patients. 
      Putative circular RNA transcripts were decreased in platelets from septic 
      patients. Leukocyte contamination defined by CD45 abundance levels in 
      RNA-sequencing was absent in both groups. Principal component analysis of 
      transcripts showed only partial overlap of clustering with IPF levels. RNA 
      sequencing showed up-regulation of 524 and down-regulation of 118 genes in 
      platelets from sepsis patients compared to controls. Upregulated genes were 
      mostly related to catabolic processes and protein translation. Comparison to 
      published platelet transcriptomes showed a large overlap of changes observed in 
      sepsis and COVID-19 but not with reticulated platelets from healthy donors. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients with sepsis appear to have a less degraded platelet 
      transcriptome as indicated by increased levels of immature platelets and 
      decreased levels of putative circular RNA transcripts. The present data suggests 
      that increased protein translation is a characteristic mechanism of systemic 
      inflammation.

      interactive cellular mechanism promoting pulmonary fibrosis.

LID - 10.1002/jcp.30687 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive lung disease with few 
      effective treatment options. We found a highly significant correlation between 
      pregnancy-associated plasma protein (PAPP)-A expression in IPF lung tissue and 
      disease severity as measured by various pulmonary and physical function tests. 
      PAPP-A is a metalloproteinase that enhances local insulin-like growth factor 
      (IGF) activity. We used primary cultures of normal adult human lung fibroblasts 
      (NHLF) to test the hypothesis that PAPP-A plays an important role in the 
      development of pulmonary fibrosis. Treatment of NHLF with pro-fibrotic 
      transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta stimulated marked increases in IGF-I mRNA 
      expression (>20-fold) and measurable IGF-I levels in 72-h conditioned medium 
      (CM). TGF-beta treatment also increased PAPP-A levels in CM fourfold (p = 0.004) and 
      proteolytic activity ~2-fold. There was an indirect effect of TGF-beta to stimulate 
      signaling through the PI3K/Akt pathway, which was significantly inhibited by both 
      IGF-I-inactivating and PAPP-A inhibitory antibodies. Induction of senescence in 
      NHLF increased PAPP-A levels in CM 10-fold (p = 0.006) with attendant increased 
      proteolytic activity. Thus, PAPP-A is a novel component of the senescent lung 
      fibroblast secretome. In addition, NHLF secreted extracellular vehicles (EVs) 
      with surface-bound active PAPP-A that were increased fivefold with 
      senescence. Regulation of PAPP-A and IGF signaling by TGF-beta and cell senescence 
      suggests an interactive cellular mechanism underlying the resistance to apoptosis 
      and the progression of fibrosis in IPF. Furthermore, PAPP-A-associated EVs may be 
      a means of pro-fibrotic, pro-senescent communication with other cells in the lung 
      and, thus, a potential therapeutic target for IPF.

AB  - We sought to pinpoint the potential role of C-MYC in pulmonary fibroblast 
      proliferation in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and its mechanism. A mouse 
      model of IPF was established by injection of bleomycin. C-MYC and miR-9-5p 
      expression was determined by RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis. The interaction 
      among C-MYC, miR-9-5p, and TBPL1 was detected by ChIP assay and dual luciferase 
      reporter gene assay. After alteration of C-MYC, miR-9-5p, and TBPL1, their roles 
      in pulmonary fibrosis and collagen fiber deposition in mice as well as 
      proliferation and differentiation of pulmonary fibroblasts were assessed. 
      Upregulated C-MYC expression was seen in the lung tissues of IPF mice and its 
      silencing retarded IPF in mice. C-MYC could activate miR-9-5p that negatively 
      regulated TBPL1 expression. Up-regulated C-MYC promoted proliferation and 
      differentiation of pulmonary fibroblasts by inhibiting TBPL1 via activation of 
      miR-9-5p, thus triggering IPF. Moreover, in the lung tissues-derived cells of IPF 
      mice, C-MYC inhibitor, 10,058-F4, was observed to inhibit miR-9-5p expression, 
      thereby repressing pulmonary fibrosis by up-regulating TBPL1. Our data provided 
      evidence pinpointed the aggravative role of C-MYC in IPF by activating miR-9-5p 
      to regulate TBPL1 expression.

      and without idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is the catalytic 
      subunit of telomerase enzyme, which adds nucleotides to telomeres and counteracts 
      their length shortening. The development of a telomere maintenance mechanism 
      represents a hallmark of cancer. On the other hand, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
      (IPF) is associated with mutations in telomerase genes and shorter telomeres. IPF 
      is frequently complicated with lung cancer. AIM: To investigate the expression of 
      hTERT in lung cancer with co-existing IPF and to compare with lung cancer without 
      fibrosis. METHODS: Diagnostic lung cancerous biopsies were retrieved from 18 
      patients with lung cancer and concomitant IPF, as well as 18 age and gender 
      matched controls with lung cancer without pulmonary fibrosis. The expression of 
      hTERT was studied with immunohistochemistry. ImajeJ software was used to 
      quantitate subcellular stain intensity. Immunohistochemical investigation of two 
      senescence-associated markers, p16 and p21, was also performed in all 36 cases. 
      RESULTS: Both groups highly expressed hTERT, without significant difference (100% 
      vs 95%, p = 0.521). Evaluation of p16 and p21 immunostaining revealed negative to 
      minimal immunoreactivity in both groups. hTERT localization exhibited higher 
      median nuclear intensity in the group of lung cancer with IPF (0.62 vs 0.45, p = 
      0.016), while cytoplasmic intensity did not differ significantly (0.17 vs 0.15, p 
      = 0.463). Higher median nuclear intensity was also correlated with small cell 
      lung cancer subtype in the whole study sample (0.69 vs 0.45, p = 0.09). 
      CONCLUSION: hTERT is highly expressed in lung cancer with concomitant IPF, but 
      with differential localization compared to lung cancer without IPF, implying 
      differences in pathogenicity and requiring further investigation.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of Gene Expression in Fibroblastic Foci in Patients with 
      Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis and Pulmonary Sarcoidosis.
LID - 10.3390/cells11040664 [doi]
LID - 664
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fibroblastic foci (FF) are characteristic features of usual 
      interstitial pneumonia (UIP)/idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and one cardinal 
      feature thought to represent a key mechanism of pathogenesis. Hence, FF have a 
      high impact on UIP/IPF diagnosis in current guidelines. However, although less 
      frequent, these histomorphological hallmarks also occur in other fibrotic 
      pulmonary diseases. Currently, there is therefore a gap in knowledge regarding 
      the underlying molecular similarities and differences of FF in different disease 
      entities. METHODS: In this work, we analyzed the compartment-specific gene 
      expression profiles of FF in IPF and sarcoidosis in order to elucidate 
      similarities and differences as well as shared pathomechanisms. For this purpose, 
      we used laser capture microdissection, mRNA and protein expression analysis. 
      Biological pathway analysis was performed using two different gene expression 
      databases. As control samples, we used healthy lung tissue that was donated but 
      not used for lung transplantation. RESULTS: Based on Holm Bonferroni corrected 
      expression data, mRNA expression analysis revealed a significantly altered 
      expression signature for 136 out of 760 genes compared to healthy controls while 
      half of these showed a similar regulation in both groups. Immunostaining of 
      selected markers from each group corroborated these results. However, when 
      comparing all differentially expressed genes with the fdr-based expression data, 
      only 2 of these genes were differentially expressed between sarcoidosis and IPF 
      compared to controls, i.e., calcium transport protein 1 (CAT1) and SMAD specific 
      E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (SMURF1), both in the sarcoidosis group. Direct 
      comparison of sarcoidosis and IPF did not show any differentially regulated genes 
      independent from the statistical methodology. Biological pathway analysis 
      revealed a number of fibrosis-related pathways pronounced in IPF without 
      differences in the regulatory direction. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate 
      that FF of end-stage IPF and sarcoidosis lungs, although different in initiation, 
      are similar in gene and protein expression, encouraging further studies on the 
      use of antifibrotic agents in sarcoidosis.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an idiopathic interstitial lung disease. 
      At present, the pathogenesis of IPF has not been fully elucidated, which has 
      affected the development of effective treatment methods. Here, we explored the 
      function and potential mechanism of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) CDKN2B antisense 
      RNA 1 (CDKN2B-AS1) in IPF.Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and bleomycin 
      (BLM) were used to induce IPF in cells and animal models. Real Time quantitative 
      Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) showed the expression of CDKN2B-AS1, 
      miR-199a-5p and Sestrin-2 (SESN2) in cells and tissues. The double luciferase 
      reporter gene assay confirmed the targeting relationship among CDKN2B-AS1, 
      miR-199a-5p, and SESN2. Related protein levels were detected by Western blot 
      combined with Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), wound healing, and flow cytometry to 
      analyze cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. The pathological 
      characteristics of mouse lung tissue were determined by Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) 
      and Masson staining. We found that the expression of CDKN2B-AS1 was decreased in 
      TGF-beta-treated cells and BLM-treated mice. Overexpression of CDKN2B-AS1 inhibited 
      cell proliferation and migration, promoted apoptosis, decreased the expression of 
      fibrosis-related proteins and promoted autophagy. In addition, overexpression of 
      CDKN2B-AS1 alleviated pulmonary fibrosis in BLM-treated mice. Mechanistically, 
      CDKN2B-AS1 acts as a miR-199a-5p sponge to regulate SESN2 expression. Our results 
      indicate the importance of the CDKN2B-AS1/miR-199a-5p/SESN2 axis.

AB  - Although inhibition of T cell coinhibitory receptors has revolutionized cancer 
      therapy, the mechanisms governing their expression on human T cells have not been 
      elucidated. In the present study, we show that type 1 interferon (IFN-I) 
      regulates coinhibitory receptor expression on human T cells, inducing 
      PD-1/TIM-3/LAG-3 while inhibiting TIGIT expression. High-temporal-resolution mRNA 
      profiling of IFN-I responses established the dynamic regulatory networks 
      uncovering three temporal transcriptional waves. Perturbation of key 
      transcription factors (TFs) and TF footprint analysis revealed two regulator 
      modules with different temporal kinetics that control expression of coinhibitory 
      receptors and IFN-I response genes, with SP140 highlighted as one of the key 
      regulators that differentiates LAG-3 and TIGIT expression. Finally, we found that 
      the dynamic IFN-I response in vitro closely mirrored T cell features in acute 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. The identification of unique TFs controlling coinhibitory 
      receptor expression under IFN-I response may provide targets for enhancement of 
      immunotherapy in cancer, infectious diseases and autoimmunity.

TI  - Emerging Roles of Airway Epithelial Cells in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.
LID - 10.3390/cells11061050 [doi]
LID - 1050
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal disease with incompletely 
      understood aetiology and limited treatment options. Traditionally, IPF was 
      believed to be mainly caused by repetitive injuries to the alveolar epithelium. 
      Several recent lines of evidence, however, suggest that IPF equally involves an 
      aberrant airway epithelial response, which contributes significantly to disease 
      development and progression. In this review, based on recent clinical, 
      high-resolution imaging, genetic, and single-cell RNA sequencing data, we 
      summarize alterations in airway structure, function, and cell type composition in 
      IPF. We furthermore give a comprehensive overview on the genetic and mechanistic 
      evidence pointing towards an essential role of airway epithelial cells in IPF 
      pathogenesis and describe potentially implicated aberrant epithelial signalling 
      pathways and regulation mechanisms in this context. The collected evidence argues 
      for the investigation of possible therapeutic avenues targeting these processes, 
      which thus represent important future directions of research.

TI  - Caveolin-1-Derived Peptide Reduces ER Stress and Enhances Gelatinolytic Activity 
      in IPF Fibroblasts.
LID - 10.3390/ijms23063316 [doi]
LID - 3316
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal disease characterized by an excess 
      deposition of extracellular matrix in the pulmonary interstitium. Caveolin-1 
      scaffolding domain peptide (CSP) has been found to mitigate pulmonary fibrosis in 
      several animal models. However, its pathophysiological role in IPF is obscure, 
      and it remains critical to understand the mechanism by which CSP protects against 
      pulmonary fibrosis. We first studied the delivery of CSP into cells and found 
      that it is internalized and accumulated in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). 
      Furthermore, CSP reduced ER stress via suppression of inositol requiring enzyme1alpha 
      (IRE1alpha) in transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta)-treated human IPF lung fibroblasts 
      (hIPF-Lfs). Moreover, we found that CSP enhanced the gelatinolytic activity of 
      TGFbeta-treated hIPF-Lfs. The IRE1alpha inhibitor; 4micro8C also augmented the gelatinolytic 
      activity of TGFbeta-treated hIPF-Lfs, supporting the concept that CSP induced 
      inhibition of the IRE1alpha pathway. Furthermore, CSP significantly elevated 
      expression of MMPs in TGFbeta-treated hIPF-Lfs, but conversely decreased the 
      secretion of collagen 1. Similar results were observed in two preclinical murine 
      models of PF, bleomycin (BLM)- and adenovirus expressing constitutively active 
      TGFbeta (Ad-TGFbeta)-induced PF. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanism 
      by which lung fibroblasts contribute to CSP dependent protection against lung 
      fibrosis.

AB  - In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), basal-like cells are atypically present 
      in the alveolar region, where they may affect adjacent stromal cells by paracrine 
      mechanisms. We here aimed to confirm the presence of basal-like cells in 
      peripheral IPF lung tissue in vivo, to culture and characterize the cells in 
      vitro, and to investigate their paracrine effects on IPF fibroblasts in vitro and 
      in bleomycin-injured rats in vivo. Basal-like cells are mainly localized in areas 
      of pathological bronchiolization or honeycomb cysts in peripheral IPF lung 
      tissue. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) demonstrated an overall 
      homogeneity, the expression of the basal cell markers cytokeratin KRT5 and KRT17, 
      and close transcriptomic similarities to basal cells in the majority of cells 
      cultured in vitro. Basal-like cells secreted significant levels of prostaglandin 
      E2 (PGE2), and their conditioned medium (CM) inhibited alpha-smooth muscle actin 
      (alpha-SMA) and collagen 1A1 (Col1A1) and upregulated matrix metalloproteinase-1 
      (MMP-1) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) by IPF fibroblasts in vitro. The 
      instillation of CM in bleomycin-injured rat lungs resulted in reduced collagen 
      content, improved lung architecture, and reduced alpha-SMA-positive cells. Our data 
      suggested that basal-like cells may limit aberrant fibroblast activation and 
      differentiation in IPF through paracrine mechanisms.

AB  - Aims: Current idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) therapies usually show a poor 
      outcome or treatment efficacy. The search for new risk factors has significant 
      implications in preventing, delaying, and treating IPF. The association between 
      obesity and the risk of IPF is not clear. This study aimed to investigate the 
      role of different obesity types in IPF risk, which provides the possibility of 
      weight loss as a new approach for IPF prevention. Methods: We conducted a 
      two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to assess the causal effect of 
      obesity on IPF risk. We collected summary data of genetically determined 
      obesity-related traits, including body mass index (BMI), waist circumference 
      (WC), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) from large-scale consortia (the sample size 
      ranging from 232,101 to 681,275), and genetic association with IPF from one of 
      the largest meta-analyses including 2,668 cases. A total of 35-469 single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms were selected as instrumental variables for 
      obesity-related traits. We further performed multivariable MR to estimate the 
      independent effect of BMI and WC on the risk of IPF. Results: Increased BMI and 
      WC were associated with higher risk of IPF [odds ratio (OR) = 1.51, 95% 
      confidence interval (CI) (1.22-1.87), p = 1.27 x 10(-4), and OR = 1.71, 95% CI 
      (1.08-2.72), p = 2.33 x 10(-2), respectively]. Similar results for the BMI and WC 
      were obtained in the replicated analysis. Subsequently, only the result for BMI 
      survived following the multiple testing correction and showed good consistency 
      with the weighted median estimator. Sensitivity analyses indicated that there was 
      no heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy for MR estimations. Further 
      multivariable MR suggested that the BMI showed the same direction and similar 
      magnitude with that in the univariable MR analysis. There was little evidence to 
      support the causal role of WHR on the risk of IPF in this study. Conclusion: 
      Genetically determined BMI demonstrates a causal risk for IPF, which offers a 
      novel insight into probing potential mechanisms. Meanwhile, these results also 
      suggest that weight loss may be beneficial to IPF prevention.

TI  - The oncogenic landscape of the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a narrative review.
PG  - 472-496
LID - 10.21037/tlcr-21-880 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Translational research is a source of continuous 
      innovation in medicine, more particularly for clinical research on new treatment 
      modalities in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients. However, the 
      heterogeneity of the disease is well recognized, and different pathological and 
      molecular settings have been identified. The molecular mechanisms by which IPF 
      proceeds in time and space remains poorly understood. Although some IPF features 
      are reminiscent of cancer, the dynamics of malignant divergent clonal selective 
      pressure and heterogeneity clearly differ from those occurring in IPF. This is 
      reflected in the absence of patient proper selection and stratification to 
      biological agents (pirfenidone, nintedanib) which limit therapeutic efficacy. 
      Consequently, increased costs are related to the clinical management of advanced 
      IPF patients. Steady collaboration and fluid communication between 
      pneumo-oncologists, radiologists and molecular biologists is a clear priority for 
      the correct interpretation of tests and the definition of effective personalized 
      strategies against this orphan disease. The present work aims at providing the 
      most relevant hints shared by cancer and IPF. METHODS: A systematic literature 
      review was performed to identify all relevant data. The examined databases were 
      Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, Google Scholar, and PubMed. The last search was 
      run on January 5, 2022. We have primarily conducted separated research for lung 
      cancer, IPF, genetics, epigenetics, surgery in IPF and cancer. KEY CONTENT AND 
      FINDINGS: The data here presented mainly focus on gene mutations, epigenetics and 
      novel therapeutic approaches. Moreover, epidemiology, prognostic variables and in 
      new treatment strategies adopted in patients with IPF and lung cancer are 
      discussed as well. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the findings of this narrative review 
      will be of help in defining the key molecular features that could applied in IPF 
      setting with promising rationale to improve therapy and to better manage those 
      cases carrying IPF and cancer concomitantly.

LID - 10.1172/jci.insight.142984 [doi]
LID - e142984
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal disease with limited treatment 
      options. The role of the developmental transcription factor Sine oculis homeobox 
      homolog 1 (SIX1) in the pathophysiology of lung fibrosis is not known. IPF lung 
      tissue samples and IPF-derived alveolar type II cells (AT2) showed a significant 
      increase in SIX1 mRNA and protein levels, and the SIX1 transcriptional 
      coactivators EYA1 and EYA2 were elevated. Six1 was also upregulated in 
      bleomycin-treated (BLM-treated) mice and in a model of spontaneous lung fibrosis 
      driven by deletion of Telomeric Repeat Binding Factor 1 (Trf1) in AT2 cells. 
      Conditional deletion of Six1 in AT2 cells prevented or halted BLM-induced lung 
      fibrosis, as measured by a significant reduction in histological burden of 
      fibrosis, reduced fibrotic mediator expression, and improved lung function. These 
      effects were associated with increased macrophage migration inhibitory factor 
      (MIF) in lung epithelial cells in vivo following SIX1 overexpression in 
      BLM-induced fibrosis. A MIF promoter-driven luciferase assay demonstrated direct 
      binding of Six1 to the 5'-TCAGG-3' consensus sequence of the MIF promoter, 
      identifying a likely mechanism of SIX1-driven MIF expression in the pathogenesis 
      of lung fibrosis and providing a potentially novel pathway for targeting in IPF 
      therapy.

TI  - Bronchial epithelium epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity forms aberrant 
      basaloid-like cells in vitro.
PG  - L822-L841
LID - 10.1152/ajplung.00254.2021 [doi]
AB  - Although epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a common feature of fibrotic 
      lung disease, its role in fibrogenesis is controversial. Recently, aberrant 
      basaloid cells were identified in fibrotic lung tissue as a novel epithelial cell 
      type displaying a partial EMT phenotype. The developmental origin of these cells 
      remains unknown. To elucidate the role of EMT in the development of aberrant 
      basaloid cells from the bronchial epithelium, we mapped EMT-induced 
      transcriptional changes at the population and single-cell levels. Human bronchial 
      epithelial cells grown as submerged or air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures with 
      or without EMT induction were analyzed by bulk and single-cell RNA-Sequencing. 
      Comparison of submerged and ALI cultures revealed differential expression of 
      8,247 protein coding (PC) and 1,621 long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) genes and 
      revealed epithelial cell-type-specific lncRNAs. Similarly, EMT induction in ALI 
      cultures resulted in robust transcriptional reprogramming of 6,020 PC and 907 
      lncRNA genes. Although there was no evidence for fibroblast/myofibroblast 
      conversion following EMT induction, cells displayed a partial EMT gene signature 
      and an aberrant basaloid-like cell phenotype. The substantial transcriptional 
      differences between submerged and ALI cultures highlight that care must be taken 
      when interpreting data from submerged cultures. This work supports that lung 
      epithelial EMT does not generate fibroblasts/myofibroblasts and confirms ALI 
      cultures provide a physiologically relevant system to study aberrant 
      basaloid-like cells and mechanisms of EMT. We provide a catalog of PC and lncRNA 
      genes and an interactive browser (https://bronc-epi-in-vitro.cells.ucsc.edu/) of 
      single-cell RNA-Seq data for further exploration of potential roles in the lung 
      epithelium in health and lung disease.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) was considered as a telomere-mediated 
      disease. TERT and TERC correlated with telomere length. Although telomerase gene 
      mutations were associated with IPF, majority patients did not carry mutations. 
      The mechanism by which telomerase expression was regulated in IPF are still 
      unclear. In this study, we aimed to delineate the mechanisms that how TERT 
      protein expression were regulated in alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) in 
      pulmonary fibrosis. Here, we found that P16, P21 and fibrosis markers (alphaSMA and 
      Collagen-I) were prominently increased in lung tissues of IPF patients and 
      bleomycin-induced mouse models, while the expression of KLF4 and TERT were 
      decreased in AECs. In vivo experiments, AAV-6 vectors mediated KLF4 
      over-expression with specific SP-C promoter was constructed. Over-expression of 
      KLF4 in AECs could protect TERT expression and suppress the development of 
      pulmonary fibrosis in bleomycin-induced mouse models. In the mechanism 
      exploration of TERT regulation, KLF4 and TERT were both down-regulated in 
      bleomycin-induced senescent MLE-12 and BEAS-2B cells. Compared with control 
      group, small-interfering RNA targeting KLF4 significantly reduced the TERT 
      expression and telomerase activity, while overexpression of KLF4 can increased 
      the expression of TERT and telomerase activity in senescent AECs. Furthermore, 
      ChIP showed that KLF4 protein could bind to the TERT promoter region in MLE-12 
      cells, suggesting that KLF4 could implicate in pathogenesis of lung fibrosis 
      through regulating TERT transcription in AECs. Taken together, this study 
      identified that KLF4 might be a promising potential target for further 
      understanding the mechanism and developing novel strategy for the treatment of 
      lung fibrosis in IPF.

AB  - BACKGROUND: HPS-1 is a genetic type of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) with 
      highly penetrant pulmonary fibrosis (HPSPF), a restrictive lung disease that is 
      similar to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Hps1(ep/ep) (pale ear) is a 
      naturally occurring HPS-1 mouse model that exhibits high sensitivity to 
      bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis (PF). Traditional methods of administering 
      bleomycin as an intratracheal (IT) route to induce PF in this model often lead to 
      severe acute lung injury and high mortality rates, complicating studies focusing 
      on pathobiological mechanisms or exploration of therapeutic options for HPSPF. 
      METHODS: To develop a murine model of HPSPF that closely mimics the progression 
      of human pulmonary fibrosis, we investigated the pulmonary effects of systemic 
      delivery of bleomycin in Hps1(ep/ep) mice using a subcutaneous minipump and 
      compared results to oropharyngeal delivery of bleomycin. RESULTS: Our study 
      revealed that systemic delivery of bleomycin induced limited, acute inflammation 
      that resolved. The distinct inflammatory phase preceded a slow, gradually 
      progressive fibrogenesis that was shown to be both time-dependent and 
      dose-dependent. The fibrosis phase exhibited characteristics that better 
      resembles human disease with focal regions of fibrosis that were predominantly 
      found in peribronchovascular areas and in subpleural regions; central lung areas 
      contained relatively less fibrosis. CONCLUSION: This model provides a preclinical 
      tool that will allow researchers to study the mechanism of pulmonary fibrosis in 
      HPS and provide a platform for the development of therapeutics to treat HPSPF. 
      This method can be applied on studies of IPF or other monogenic disorders that 
      lead to pulmonary fibrosis.

TI  - Canonical and noncanonical regulatory roles for JAK2 in the pathogenesis of 
      rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease and idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - e22336
LID - 10.1096/fj.202101436R [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and rheumatoid arthritis-associated 
      interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD) are two fibrotic interstitial lung diseases 
      that share the usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) injury pattern. Here, we report 
      that RNA sequencing of lung biopsies from patients with RA-ILD and IPF revealed 
      shared and distinct disease-causing pathways. Analysis of transcriptomic data 
      identified a JAK2 related JAK/STAT signaling pathway gene signature that 
      distinguishes RA-UIP from idiopathic UIP. This was further confirmed by 
      immunohistostaining, which identified JAK2 phosphorylation with two distinct 
      forms of activation: a cytoplasmic form of JAK2 activation in most IPF cases 
      (13/20) and a nuclear form of p-JAK2 in RA-UIP (5/5) and a minority of IPF (6/20) 
      cases. Further immunohistostaining identified STAT5A&B as the downstream 
      transcriptional activator for JAK2-mediated canonical signal transduction and 
      phosphorylation of Tyr41 on histone H3 (H3Y41ph) as the downstream epigenetic 
      regulation site for JAK2-mediated noncanonical signal transduction. Gene Set 
      Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of the RNA-Seq data further supported this shared 
      pathogenic mechanism for the two diseases with the enrichment of STAT5A&B target 
      gene sets as well as the JAK2 regulated H3Y41ph target gene set. This regulatory 
      role of JAK2 in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis was further demonstrated 
      by the attenuation of bleomycin-induced murine pulmonary fibrosis using a 
      JAK2-selective pharmacological inhibitor CEP33779. In vitro studies with normal 
      and IPF derived lung fibroblasts revealed a central role for JAK2 as an essential 
      intermediary molecule in TGF-beta-mediated myofibroblast trans-differentiation, 
      proliferation, and extracellular matrix protein production. These observations 
      support a crucial role for JAK2 as an intermediary molecule in fibrotic lung 
      disease development.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating and common chronic lung 
      disease that is pathologically characterized by the destruction of lung 
      architecture and the accumulation of extracellular matrix in the lung. Previous 
      studies have shown an association between lung surfactant protein (SP) and the 
      pathogenesis of IPF, as demonstrated by mutations and the altered expression of 
      SP in patients with IPF. However, the role of SP in the development of lung 
      fibrosis is poorly understood. In this study, the role of surfactant protein A 
      (SP-A) was explored in experimental lung fibrosis induced with a low or high dose 
      of bleomycin (BLM) and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic deletion of SP-A. Our results 
      showed that lung SP-A deficiency in mice promoted the development of fibrotic 
      damage and exacerbated inflammatory responses to the BLM challenge. In vitro 
      experiments with murine lung epithelial LA-4 cells demonstrated that in response 
      to transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), LA-4 cells had a decreased protein 
      expression of SP-A. Furthermore, exogenous SP administration to LA-4 cells 
      inhibited the TGF-beta1-induced upregulation of fibrotic markers. Overall, these 
      findings suggest a novel antifibrotic mechanism of SP-A in the development of 
      lung fibrosis, which indicates the therapeutic potential of the lung SP-A in 
      preventing the development of IPF.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary fibrosis is an age-related, progressive, and fatal 
      disease with a median survival of 3-5 years after diagnosis; idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF) is the most common type. It is characterized by fibroblast 
      proliferation and accumulation of excessive extracellular matrix. Patients with 
      IPF are at increased risk for lung cancer. Epigenetic mechanisms are involved in 
      lung fibrosis and cancer, and DNA methylation is critical in disease pathogenesis 
      and progression. Therefore, studies of DNA methylation contribute to better 
      understanding of the underlying mechanisms of these two respiratory diseases, and 
      can offer novel diagnostic and treatment options. AREAS COVERED: This review 
      discusses the latest advances in our understanding of epigenetic factors related 
      to DNA methylation that impact development of lung cancer and pulmonary fibrosis, 
      discusses the role of DNA methylation in promoting or inhibiting these diseases, 
      and proposes its potential clinical significance in disease diagnosis and 
      treatment. EXPERT OPINION: DNA methylation plays a critical role in lung cancer 
      and fibrosis pathogenesis. DNA methylation offers a new biomarker for disease 
      diagnosis or monitoring, and provides a new therapeutic target for treatment.

AB  - Cellular senescence represents a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest 
      occurring naturally or in response to exogenous stressors. Following the initial 
      arrest, progressive phenotypic changes define conditions of cellular senescence. 
      Understanding molecular mechanisms that drive senescence can help to recognize 
      the importance of such pathways in lung health and disease. There is increasing 
      interest in the role of cellular senescence in conditions such as chronic 
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in 
      the context of understanding pathophysiology and identification of novel 
      therapies. Herein, we discuss the current knowledge of molecular mechanisms and 
      mitochondrial dysfunction regulating different aspects of cellular 
      senescence-related to chronic lung diseases to develop rational strategies for 
      modulating the senescent cell phenotype in the lung for therapeutic benefit.

AB  - CTGF is upregulated in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), 
      characterized by the deposition of a pathological extracellular matrix (ECM). 
      Additionally, many omics studies confirmed that aberrant cellular 
      senescence-associated mitochondria dysfunction and metabolic reprogramming had 
      been identified in different IPF lung cells (alveolar epithelial cells, alveolar 
      endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages). Here, we reviewed the role of 
      the CTGF in IPF lung cells to mediate anomalous senescence-related metabolic 
      mechanisms that support the fibrotic environment in IPF.

AB  - The increased resolution of single-cell RNA-sequencing technologies has led to 
      major breakthroughs and improved our understanding of the normal and pathologic 
      conditions of multiple tissues and organs. In the study of parenchymal lung 
      disease, single-cell RNA-sequencing has better delineated known cell populations 
      and identified novel cells and changes in cellular phenotypes and gene expression 
      patterns associated with disease. In this review, we aim to highlight the 
      advances and insights that have been made possible by applying these technologies 
      to two seemingly very different lung diseases: fibrotic interstitial lung 
      diseases, a group of relentlessly progressive lung diseases leading to pulmonary 
      fibrosis, and COVID-19 pneumonia, an acute viral disease with life-threatening 
      complications, including pulmonary fibrosis. We discuss changes in cell 
      populations and gene expression, highlighting potential common features, such as 
      alveolar cell epithelial injury and aberrant repair and monocyte-derived 
      macrophage populations, as well as relevance and implications to mechanisms of 
      disease and future directions.

TI  - Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) and SNP-SNP Interactions of the Surfactant 
      Protein Genes Are Associated With Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis in a Mexican 
      Study Group; Comparison With Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis.

AB  - Surfactant proteins (SPs) are important for normal lung function and innate 
      immunity of the lungs and their genes have been identified with significant 
      genetic variability. Changes in quantity or quality of SPs due to genetic 
      mutations or natural genetic variability may alter their functions and contribute 
      to the host susceptibility for particular diseases. Alternatively, SP single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can serve as markers to identify disease risk or 
      response to therapies, as shown for other genes in a number of other studies. In 
      the current study, we evaluated associations of SFTP SNPs with idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) by studying novel computational models where the 
      epistatic effects (dominant, additive, recessive) of SNP-SNP interactions could 
      be evaluated, and then compared the results with a previously published 
      hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) study where the same novel models were used. 
      Mexican Hispanic patients (IPF=84 & HP=75) and 194 healthy control individuals 
      were evaluated. The goal was to identify SP SNPs and SNP-SNP interactions that 
      associate with IPF as well as SNPs and interactions that may be unique to each of 
      these interstitial diseases or common between them. We observed: 1) in terms of 
      IPF, i) three single SFTPA1 SNPs to associate with decreased IPF risk, ii) three 
      SFTPA1 haplotypes to associate with increased IPF risk, and iii) a number of 
      three-SNP interactions to associate with IPF susceptibility. 2) Comparison of IPF 
      and HP, i) three SFTPA1 and one SFTPB SNP associated with decreased risk in IPF 
      but increased risk in HP, and one SFTPA1 SNP associated with decreased risk in 
      both IPF and HP, ii) a number of three-SNP interactions with the same or 
      different effect pattern associated with IPF and/or HP susceptibility, iii) one 
      of the three-SNP interactions that involved SNPs of SFTPA1, SFTPA2, and SFTPD, 
      with the same effect pattern, was associated with a disease-specific outcome, a 
      decreased and increased risk in HP and IPF, respectively. This is the first study 
      that compares the SP gene variants in these two phenotypically similar diseases. 
      Our findings indicate that SNPs of all SFTPs may play an important role in the 
      genetic susceptibility to IPF and HP. Importantly, IPF and HP share some SP 
      genetic variants, suggesting common pathophysiological mechanisms and pathways 
      regarding surfactant biogenesis, but also some differences, highlighting the 
      diverse underlying pathogenic mechanisms between an inflammatory-driven fibrosis 
      (HP) and an epithelial-driven fibrosis (IPF). Alternatively, the significant SNPs 
      identified here, along with SNPs of other genes, could serve as markers to 
      distinguish these two devastating diseases.

TI  - Thromboxane-Prostanoid Receptor Signaling Drives Persistent Fibroblast Activation 
      in Pulmonary Fibrosis.
PG  - 596-607
LID - 10.1164/rccm.202106-1503OC [doi]
AB  - Rationale: Although persistent fibroblast activation is a hallmark of idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), mechanisms regulating persistent fibroblast activation 
      in the lungs have not been fully elucidated. Objectives: On the basis of our 
      observation that lung fibroblasts express TBXA2R (thromboxane-prostanoid 
      receptor) during fibrosis, we investigated the role of TBXA2R signaling in 
      fibrotic remodeling. Methods: We identified TBXA2R expression in lungs of 
      patients with IPF and mice and studied primary mouse and human lung fibroblasts 
      to determine the impact of TBXA2R signaling on fibroblast activation. We used 
      TBXA2R-deficient mice and small-molecule inhibitors to investigate TBXA2R 
      signaling in preclinical lung fibrosis models. Measurements and Main Results: 
      TBXA2R expression was upregulated in fibroblasts in the lungs of patients with 
      IPF and in mouse lungs during experimental lung fibrosis. Genetic deletion of 
      TBXA2R, but not inhibition of thromboxane synthase, protected mice from 
      bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, thereby suggesting that an alternative ligand 
      activates profibrotic TBXA2R signaling. In contrast to thromboxane, 
      F2-isoprostanes, which are nonenzymatic products of arachidonic acid induced by 
      reactive oxygen species, were persistently elevated during fibrosis. 
      F2-isoprostanes induced TBXA2R signaling in fibroblasts and mediated a 
      myofibroblast activation profile due, at least in part, to potentiation of TGF-beta 
      (transforming growth factor-beta) signaling. In vivo treatment with the TBXA2R 
      antagonist ifetroban reduced profibrotic signaling in the lungs, protected mice 
      from lung fibrosis in three preclinical models (bleomycin, Hermansky-Pudlak mice, 
      and radiation-induced fibrosis), and markedly enhanced fibrotic resolution after 
      bleomycin treatment. Conclusions: TBXA2R links oxidative stress to fibroblast 
      activation during lung fibrosis. TBXA2R antagonists could have utility in 
      treating pulmonary fibrosis.

TI  - Role of MicroRNAs in Signaling Pathways Associated with the Pathogenesis of 
      Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis: A Focus on Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition.
LID - 10.3390/ijms23126613 [doi]
LID - 6613
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive disease with 
      high mortality and unclear etiology. Previous evidence supports that the origin 
      of this disease is associated with epigenetic alterations, age, and environmental 
      factors. IPF initiates with chronic epithelial lung injuries, followed by basal 
      membrane destruction, which promotes the activation of myofibroblasts and 
      excessive synthesis of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, as well as 
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Due to miRNAs' role as regulators of 
      apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation, and cell-cell interaction processes, 
      some studies have involved miRNAs in the biogenesis and progression of IPF. In 
      this context, the analysis and discussion of the probable association of miRNAs 
      with the signaling pathways involved in the development of IPF would improve our 
      knowledge of the associated molecular mechanisms, thereby facilitating its 
      evaluation as a therapeutic target for this severe lung disease. In this work, 
      the most recent publications evaluating the role of miRNAs as regulators or 
      activators of signal pathways associated with the pathogenesis of IPF were 
      analyzed. The search in Pubmed was made using the following terms: "miRNAs and 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)"; "miRNAs and IPF and signaling pathways 
      (SP)"; and "miRNAs and IPF and SP and IPF pathogenesis". Additionally, we focus 
      mainly on those works where the signaling pathways involved with EMT, fibroblast 
      differentiation, and synthesis of ECM components were assessed. Finally, the 
      importance and significance of miRNAs as potential therapeutic or diagnostic 
      tools for the treatment of IPF are discussed.

PG  - 296-302

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Growing evidence suggests that ageing-associated alterations 
      occur in both idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and chronic obstructive 
      pulmonary disease (COPD). Here, we review the most recent literature on 
      dysregulated ageing pathways in IPF and COPD and discuss how they may contribute 
      to disease pathogenesis. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have shown that alveolar 
      epithelial type II (ATII) cells undergo premature senescence under stress and 
      that senescent ATII cells promote lung fibrogenesis. Some studies have explored 
      the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in IPF. They have provided evidence that 
      dysfunctional mitochondria are important contributors to fibrogenesis through 
      release of damaged DNA and excessive formation of reactive oxygen species, 
      whereas restoration of mitochondrial homeostasis may attenuate lung fibrosis. 
      Insufficient autophagy has been shown to promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal 
      transition and aberrant epithelial-fibroblast crosstalk, suggesting that 
      autophagy augmentation may represent a potential therapeutic strategy. A number 
      of studies have also explored the role of cellular senescence, mitochondrial 
      homeostasis and autophagy in COPD. SUMMARY: Several ageing mechanisms are 
      dysregulated in the lungs of patients with IPF and COPD, although how they 
      contribute to disease development and progression remains elusive. Genetic or 
      pharmacologic attenuation of senescence-related pathways and elimination of 
      senescent cells may represent a promising therapeutic strategy.

AB  - The pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and its histological 
      counterpart, usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) remains debated. IPF/UIP is a 
      disease characterised by respiratory restriction, and while there have been 
      recent advances in treatment, mortality remains high. Genetic and environmental 
      factors predispose to its development and aberrant alveolar repair is thought to 
      be central. Following alveolar injury, the type II pneumocyte (AEC2) replaces the 
      damaged thin type I pneumocytes. Despite the interstitial fibroblast being 
      considered instrumental in formation of the fibrosis, there has been little 
      consideration for a role for AEC2 in the repair of the septal interstitium. 
      Elastin is a complex protein that conveys flexibility and recoil to the lung. The 
      fibroblast is presumed to produce elastin but there is evidence that the AEC2 may 
      have a role in production or deposition. While the lung is an elastic organ, the 
      role of elastin in repair of lung injury and its possible role in UIP has not 
      been explored in depth. In this paper, pathogenetic mechanisms of UIP involving 
      AEC2 and elastin are reviewed and the possible role of AEC2 in elastin generation 
      is proposed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a refractory disease. 
      Therefore, developing effective therapies for IPF is the need of the hour. 
      PURPOSE: Yiqi Huoxue Formula (YQHX) is an herbal formula comprising three herbal 
      medicines: Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort. (Chuanxiong Rhizoma, CR), Panax 
      notoginseng (Burk.) F. H. Chen (Notoginseng Radix Et Rhizoma, NR) and Panax 
      ginseng C. A. Mey. (Ginseng Radix Et Rhizoma, GR). This study aims to determine 
      the anti-pulmonary fibrosis effect of YQHX and explore its mechanism of action. 
      STUDY: Design and Methods: The chemical components in the GR, CR and NR extracts 
      were identified by High Performance Liquid Chromatography. A TGF-beta1-induced 
      myofibroblast cell model was used to test the anti-fibrosis effect of GR, CR, NR 
      and YQHX. RNA-sequencing was used to identify the differentially expressed genes 
      (DEGs) after YQHX treatment. Subsequently, gene enrichment analysis and key 
      transcription factors (TFs) prediction for YQHX-regulated DEGs was performed. The 
      active constituents of GR, CR and NR were obtained from the Traditional Chinese 
      Medicine Database and Analysis Platform. Targets of the active constituents were 
      predicted using the similarity ensemble approach search server and Swiss Target 
      Prediction tool. YQHX-targeted key TFs that transcribed the DEGs were screened 
      out. Then, the effect of YQHX on the bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse 
      model was studied. Finally, one of the predicted TFs, STAT3, was selected to 
      validate the prediction accuracy. RESULTS: Seven, two, and five compounds were 
      identified in the GR, CR, and NR extracts, respectively. YQHX and its 
      constituents-GR, CR and NR-inhibited the expression of fibrotic markers, 
      including alpha -SMA and fibronectin, indicating that YQHX inhibited TGF-beta1-induced 
      myofibroblast activation. RNA-sequencing identified 291 genes that were 
      up-regulated in the TGF-beta1 group but down-regulated after YQHX treatment. In 
      total, 55 key TFs that transcribed YQHX-regulated targets were predicted. A 
      regulatory network of 24 active ingredients and 232 corresponding targets for 
      YQHX was established. Among YQHX's predicted targets, 20 were TFs. On overlapping 
      YQHX-targeted TFs and DEGs' key TFs, six key TFs, including HIF1A, STAT6, STAT3, 
      PPARA, DDIT3 and AR, were identified as the targets of YQHX. Additionally, YQHX 
      alleviated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in a mouse model by inhibiting 
      the phosphorylation of STAT3 in the lungs of pulmonary fibrosis mice. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study provides pharmacological support for the use of YQHX in 
      the treatment of IPF. The potential mechanism of action of YQHX is speculated to 
      involve the modulation of core TFs and inhibition of pathogenetic gene 
      expressions in IPF.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a severe progressive interstitial lung 
      disease with a prevalence of 2 to 29 per 100,000 of the world's population. Aging 
      is a significant risk factor for IPF, and the mechanisms of aging (telomere 
      depletion, genomic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, loss of proteostasis) 
      are involved in the pathogenesis of IPF. The pathogenesis of IPF consists of 
      TGF-beta activation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and SIRT7 expression 
      decrease. Genetic studies have shown a role of mutations and polymorphisms in 
      mucin genes (MUC5B), in the genes responsible for the integrity of telomeres 
      (TERC, TERC, TINF2, DKC1, RTEL1, PARN), in surfactant-related genes (SFTPC, 
      SFTPCA, SFTPA2, ABCA3, SP-A2), immune system genes (IL1RN, TOLLIP), and 
      haplotypes of HLA genes (DRB1*15:01, DQB1*06:02) in IPF pathogenesis. The 
      investigation of the influence of reversible epigenetic factors on the 
      development of the disease, which can be corrected by targeted therapy, shows 
      promise. Among them, an association of a number of specific microRNAs and long 
      noncoding RNAs was revealed with IPF. Therefore, dysregulation of transposons, 
      which serve as key sources of noncoding RNA and affect mechanisms of aging, may 
      serve as a driver for IPF development. This is due to the fact that pathological 
      activation of transposons leads to violation of the regulation of genes, in the 
      epigenetic control of which microRNA originating from these transposons are 
      involved (due to the complementarity of nucleotide sequences). Analysis of the 
      MDTE database (miRNAs derived from Transposable Elements) allowed the detection 
      of 12 different miRNAs derived in evolution from transposons and associated with 
      IPF (miR-31, miR-302, miR-326, miR-335, miR-340, miR-374, miR-487, miR-493, 
      miR-495, miR-630, miR-708, miR-1343). We described the relationship of 
      transposons with TGF-beta, sirtuins and telomeres, dysfunction of which is involved 
      in the pathogenesis of IPF. New data on IPF epigenetic mechanisms can become the 
      basis for improving results of targeted therapy of the disease using noncoding 
      RNAs.

AB  - Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process by which epithelial cells 
      undergo a phenotypic conversion that leads to myofibroblast formation, plays a 
      crucial role in the progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Recently, 
      it was revealed that hypoxia promotes alveolar EMT and that histone deacetylases 
      (HDACs) are abnormally overexpressed in the lung tissues of IPF patients. In this 
      study, we showed that HDAC3 regulated alveolar EMT markers via the AKT pathway 
      during hypoxia and that inhibition of HDAC3 expression by small interfering RNA 
      (siRNA) decreased the migration ability and invasiveness of diseased human lung 
      fibroblasts. Furthermore, we found that HDAC3 enhanced the migratory and invasive 
      properties of fibroblasts by positively affecting the EMT process, which in turn 
      was affected by the increased and decreased levels of microRNA (miR)-224 and 
      Forkhead Box A1 (FOXA1), respectively. Lastly, we found this mechanism to be 
      valid in an in vivo system; HDAC3 siRNA administration inhibited 
      bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Thus, it is reasonable to suggest 
      that HDAC3 may accelerate pulmonary fibrosis progression under hypoxic conditions 
      by enhancing EMT in alveolar cells through the regulation of miR-224 and FOXA1. 
      This entire process, we believe, offers a novel therapeutic approach for 
      pulmonary fibrosis.

      lungs leads to usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) and, ultimately, to death. IPF 
      affects three million people worldwide, and the only currently available 
      treatments include the antifibrotic drugs nintedanib and pirfenidone, which 
      effectively reduce fibrosis progression are, unfortunately, not effective in 
      curing the disease. In recent years, the paradigm of IPF pathogenesis has shifted 
      from a fibroblast-driven disease to an epithelium-driven disease, wherein, upon 
      recurrent microinjuries, dysfunctional alveolar type II epithelial cells (ATII) 
      are not only unable to sustain physiological lung regeneration but also promote 
      aberrant epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk. This creates a drift towards fibrosis 
      rather than regeneration. In the context of this review article, we discuss the 
      most relevant mechanisms involved in IPF pathogenesis with a specific focus on 
      the role of dysfunctional ATII cells in promoting disease progression. In 
      particular, we summarize the main causes of ATII cell dysfunction, such as aging, 
      environmental factors, and genetic determinants. Next, we describe the known 
      mechanisms of physiological lung regeneration by drawing a parallel between 
      embryonic lung development and the known pathways involved in ATII-driven 
      alveolar re-epithelization after injury. Finally, we review the most relevant 
      interventional clinical trials performed in the last 20 years with the aim of 
      underlining the urgency of developing new therapies against IPF that are not only 
      aimed at reducing disease progression by hampering ECM deposition but also boost 
      the physiological processes of ATII-driven alveolar regeneration.

AB  - Background: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and irreversible 
      fibrotic disease with high mortality. Currently, pirfenidone and nintedanib are 
      the only approved drugs for IPF by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 
      but their efficacy is limited. The activation of multiple phosphotyrosine (pY) 
      mediated signaling pathways underlying the pathological mechanism of IPF has been 
      explored. A Src homology-2 (SH2) superbinder, which contains mutations of three 
      amino acids (AAs) of natural SH2 domain has been shown to be able to block 
      phosphotyrosine (pY) pathway. Therefore, we aimed to introduce SH2 superbinder 
      into the treatment of IPF. Methods: We analyzed the database of IPF patients and 
      examined pY levels in lung tissues from IPF patients. In primary lung fibroblasts 
      obtained from IPF patient as well as bleomycin (BLM) treated mice, the cell 
      proliferation, migration and differentiation associated with pY were investigated 
      and the anti-fibrotic effect of SH2 superbinder was also tested. In vivo, we 
      further verified the safety and effectiveness of SH2 superbinder in multiple BLM 
      mice models. We also compared the anti-fibrotic effect and side-effect of SH2 
      superbinder and nintedanib in vivo. Results: The data showed that the cytokines 
      and growth factors pathways which directly correlated to pY levels were 
      significantly enriched in IPF. High pY levels were found to induce abnormal 
      proliferation, migration and differentiation of lung fibroblasts. SH2 superbinder 
      blocked pY-mediated signaling pathways and suppress pulmonary fibrosis by 
      targeting high pY levels in fibroblasts. SH2 superbinder had better therapeutic 
      effect and less side-effect compare to nintedanib in vivo. Conclusions: SH2 
      superbinder had significant anti-fibrotic effects both in vitro and in vivo, 
      which could be used as a promising therapy for IPF.

TI  - Inhibition of AHNAK nucleoprotein 2 alleviates pulmonary fibrosis by 
      downregulating the TGF-beta1/Smad3 signaling pathway.
PG  - e3442
LID - 10.1002/jgm.3442 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and advanced 
      interstitial lung disease with poor prognosis. AHNAK nucleoprotein 2 (AHNAK2) is 
      a macromolecular protein that is important for cell migration and muscle membrane 
      repair. The protein acts via epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is a 
      key mechanism in the pathogenesis of IPF. However, very few studies have 
      elucidated the effect of AHNAK2 in the development of IPF. Therefore, we aimed to 
      determine the role of AHNAK2 in IPF development. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were 
      induced with bleomycin, while A549 and Beas-2b pulmonary epithelial cell lines 
      were treated with TGF-beta1 to induce IPF model. The expression of AHNAK2 was 
      detected using immunohistochemistry staining in vivo, and real-time quantitative 
      polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blotting (WB) in vitro. C57BL/6 
      mice were injected with adeno-associated virus (AAV)-sh NC or AAV-sh AHNAK2 and 
      the pulmonary function and EMT marker expression were measured. The migratory 
      abilities of the two transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta1)-induced cell 
      lines were examined using wound-healing and Transwell assays after transfection 
      with si-NC, si-AHNAK2-1 and -2. EMT marker expression was detected using RT-qPCR 
      and WB. Smad3 and phosphorylated-Smad3 of the two cells were examined using WB. 
      Following Smad3 inhibition by Smad3 phosphorylation inhibitor (SIS3), 
      TGF-beta1-induced cell migration and EMT marker expression were evaluated again 
      after different transfections. RESULTS: AHNAK2 expression was higher in the IPF 
      model than in the normal model in vivo and in vitro. Partial inhibition of AHNAK2 
      suppressed the EMT process and improved pulmonary ventilation and compliance in 
      the mouse model of IPF. Similarly, knockdown of AHNAK2 suppressed the migration 
      of pulmonary epithelial cells and reversed EMT. Furthermore, Smad3 of the two 
      TGF-beta1-induced cell lines was not activated when AHNAK2 was inhibited. When SIS3 
      inhibited the activation of Smad3, the suppression of AHNAK2 had no effect on 
      A549 and Beas-2b, regardless of TGF-beta1 induction. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of 
      AHNAK2 alleviates pulmonary fibrosis and partially reverses EMT by inhibiting the 
      TGF-beta1/Smad3 signaling pathway. Therefore, AHNAK2 is a potential therapeutic 
      target for IPF.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disease of progressive lung fibrosis 
      with a high mortality rate. This study aimed to uncover the underlying molecular 
      features for different types of IPF. IPF microarray datasets were retrieved from 
      GEO databases. Weighted gene co-expression analysis (WGCNA) was used and 
      identified subgroup-specific WGCNA modules. Infiltration-level immune cells in 
      different subgroups of microenvironments were analyzed with CIBERSORT algorithms. 
      The result is we classified 173 IPF cases into two subgroups based on gene 
      expression profiles, which were retrieved from the GEO databases. The SGRQ score 
      and age were significantly higher in C2 than in C1. Using WGCNA, five 
      subgroup-specific modules were identified. M4 was mainly enriched by MAPK 
      signaling, which was mainly expressed in C2; M1, M2, and M3 were mainly enriched 
      by metabolic pathways and Chemokine signaling, and the pathway of M5 was 
      phagosome inflammation; M1, M2, M3, and M5 were mainly expressed in C1. Utilizing 
      the CIBERSORT, we showed that the number of M1 macrophage cells, CD8 T cells, 
      regulatory T cells (Tregs), and Plasma cells was significantly different between 
      C1 and C2. We found the molecular subgroups of IPF revealed that cases from 
      different subgroups may have their unique patterns and provide novel information 
      to understand the mechanisms of IPF itself.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal interstitial lung disease. Recent 
      studies have identified the key role of crosstalk between dysregulated epithelial 
      cells, mesenchymal, immune, and endothelial cells in IPF. In addition, genetic 
      mutations and environmental factors (e.g., smoking) have also been associated 
      with the development of IPF. With the recent development of sequencing 
      technology, epigenetics, as an intermediate link between gene expression and 
      environmental impacts, has also been reported to be implicated in pulmonary 
      fibrosis. Although the etiology of IPF is unknown, many novel therapeutic targets 
      and agents have emerged from clinical trials for IPF treatment in the past years, 
      and the successful launch of pirfenidone and nintedanib has demonstrated the 
      promising future of anti-IPF therapy. Therefore, we aimed to gain an in-depth 
      understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms and pathogenic factors of 
      IPF, which would be helpful for the diagnosis of IPF, the development of 
      anti-fibrotic drugs, and improving the prognosis of patients with IPF. In this 
      study, we summarized the pathogenic mechanism, therapeutic targets and clinical 
      trials from the perspective of multiple cell types, gene mutations, epigenetic 
      and environmental factors.

TI  - HER2 drives lung fibrosis by activating a metastatic cancer signature in invasive 
      lung fibroblasts.

LID - e20220126
AB  - Progressive tissue fibrosis, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), is 
      characterized by excessive recruitment of fibroblasts to sites of tissue injury 
      and unremitting extracellular matrix deposition associated with severe morbidity 
      and mortality. However, the molecular mechanisms that control progressive IPF 
      have yet to be fully determined. Previous studies suggested that invasive 
      fibroblasts drive disease progression in IPF. Here, we report profiling of 
      invasive and noninvasive fibroblasts from IPF patients and healthy donors. 
      Pathway analysis revealed that the activated signatures of the invasive 
      fibroblasts, the top of which was ERBB2 (HER2), showed great similarities to 
      those of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma cancer cells. Activation of HER2 in 
      normal lung fibroblasts led to a more invasive genetic program and worsened 
      fibroblast invasion and lung fibrosis, while antagonizing HER2 signaling blunted 
      fibroblast invasion and ameliorated lung fibrosis. These findings suggest that 
      HER2 signaling may be a key driver of fibroblast invasion and serve as an 
      attractive target for therapeutic intervention in IPF.

TI  - Longitudinal lung function and gas transfer in individuals with idiopathic

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an incurable lung disease 
      characterised by progressive scarring leading to alveolar stiffness, reduced lung 
      capacity, and impeded gas transfer. We aimed to identify genetic variants 
      associated with declining lung capacity or declining gas transfer after diagnosis 
      of IPF. METHODS: We did a genome-wide meta-analysis of longitudinal measures of 
      forced vital capacity (FVC) and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon 
      monoxide (DLCO) in individuals diagnosed with IPF. Individuals were recruited to 
      three studies between June, 1996, and August, 2017, from across centres in the 
      US, UK, and Spain. Suggestively significant variants were investigated further in 
      an additional independent study (CleanUP-IPF). All four studies diagnosed cases 
      following American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society guidelines. 
      Variants were defined as significantly associated if they had a meta-analysis 
      p<5 x 10(-8) when meta-analysing across all discovery and follow-up studies, had 
      consistent direction of effects across all four studies, and were nominally 
      significant (p<0.05) in each study. FINDINGS: 1329 individuals with a total of 
      5216 measures were included in the FVC analysis. 975 individuals with a total of 
      3361 measures were included in the DLCO analysis. For the discovery genome-wide 
      analyses, 7 611 174 genetic variants were included in the FVC analysis and 
      7 536 843 in the DLCO analysis. One variant (rs115982800) located in an antisense 
      RNA gene for protein kinase N2 (PKN2) showed a genome-wide significant 
      association with FVC decline (-140 mL/year per risk allele [95% CI -180 to -100]; 
      p=9.14 x 10(-12)). INTERPRETATION: Our analysis identifies a genetic variant 
      associated with disease progression, which might highlight a new biological 
      mechanism for IPF. We found that PKN2, a Rho and Rac effector protein, is the 
      most likely gene of interest from this analysis. PKN2 inhibitors are currently in 
      development and signify a potential novel therapeutic approach for IPF. FUNDING:

TI  - ADAR1 Isoforms Regulate Let-7d Processing in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.
LID - 10.3390/ijms23169028 [doi]
LID - 9028
AB  - Double-stranded RNA adenosine deaminase 1 (ADAR1) is significantly down-regulated 
      in fibroblasts derived from Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) patients, and its 
      overexpression restored levels of miRNA-21, PELI1, and SPRY2. There are two ADAR1 
      isoforms in humans, ADAR1-p110 and ADAR1-p150, generated by an alternative 
      promoter. Let-7d is considered an essential microRNA in Pulmonary Fibrosis (PF). 
      In silico analysis revealed COL3A1 and SMAD2, proteins involved in the 
      development of IPF, as Let-7d targets. We analyzed the role of ADAR1-p110 and 
      ADAR1-p150 isoforms in the regulation of Let-7d maturation and the effect of this 
      regulation on the expression of COL3A1 and SMAD2 in IPF fibroblast. We 
      demonstrated that differential expression and subcellular distribution of ADAR1 
      isoforms in fibroblasts contribute to the up-regulation of pri-miR-Let-7d and 
      down-regulation of mature Let-7d. Induction of overexpression of ADAR1 
      reestablishes the expression of pri-miR-Let-7d and Let-7d in lung fibroblasts. 
      The reduction of mature Let-7d upregulates the expression of COL3A1 and SMAD2. 
      Thus, ADAR1 isoforms and Let-7d could have a synergistic role in IPF, which is a 
      promising explanation in the mechanisms of fibrosis development, and the 
      regulation of both molecules could be used as a therapeutic approach in IPF.

TI  - USP13 Deficiency Impairs Autophagy and Facilitates Age-related Lung Fibrosis.
PG  - 49-61
LID - 10.1165/rcmb.2022-0002OC [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an age-related disease. Failure of the 
      proteostasis network with age, including insufficient autophagy, contributes to 
      the pathology of IPF. Mechanisms underlying autophagy disruption in IPF are 
      unclear and may involve regulation of USP (ubiquitin-specific protease) by 
      post-translational modifications. To expand our previous observation of low USP13 
      expression in IPF, this study evaluated the role of USP13 in age-related lung 
      fibrosis. Here, we demonstrated that Usp13-deficient aged mice exhibited impaired 
      autophagic activity and increased vulnerability to bleomycin-induced fibrosis. 
      Mechanistically, USP13 interacted with and deubiquitinated Beclin 1, and Beclin 1 
      overexpression abolished the effects of USP13 disruption. In addition, Beclin 1 
      inhibition resulted in insufficient autophagy and more severe lung fibrosis after 
      bleomycin injury, consistent with the phenotype of aged Usp13-deficient mice. 
      Collectively, we show a protective role of USP13 in age-related pulmonary 
      fibrosis. Aging-mediated USP13 loss impairs autophagic activity and facilitates 
      lung fibrosis through Beclin 1 deubiquitination. Our findings support the notion 
      that age-dependent dysregulation of autophagic regulators enhances vulnerability 
      to lung fibrosis.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive fibrous interstitial 
      lung disease of unknown etiology. IPF is also considered to be among the 
      independent risk factors for lung cancer, increasing the risk of lung cancer by 
      7% and 20%. The incidence of IPF complicated with lung cancer, especially 
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), is increasing gradually, but there is no 
      consensus on unified management and treatment. IPF and NSCLC have similar 
      pathological features. Both appear in the surrounding area of the lung. In 
      pathients with IPF complicated with NSCLC, NSCLC often develops from the 
      honeycomb region of IPF, but the mechanism of NSCLC induced by IPF remains 
      unclear. In addition, IPF and NSCLC have similar genetic, molecular and cellular 
      processes and common signal transduction pathways. The universal signal pathways 
      targeting IPF and NSCLC will become potential therapeutic drugs for IPF 
      complicated with NSCLC. This article examines the main molecular mechanisms 
      involved in IPF and NSCLC and the research progress of drugs under development 
      targeting these signal pathways. .

AB  - Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) represents the end stage of a broad range of interstitial 
      lung diseases (ILDs). Statins are among the compounds which have been implicated 
      in drug-induced ILD development. However, recent studies (both in vitro and in 
      vivo) have provided evidence that statins may exert anti-inflammatory and 
      anti-fibrotic effects potentially offering benefits to patients with PF. Several 
      protective molecular mechanisms including the suppression of mevalonic acid 
      pathway, the inhibition of NADPH oxidase activation in macrophages and the 
      inhibition of several profibrotic mediators have been proposed to explain the 
      observed in vivo decrease of the oxidative stress in the lung and the 
      preservation of lung function in patients. Earlier clinical studies relating 
      statins with drug-induced ILD development are contradicted by increasing new data 
      showing the beneficial effects of statins in clinical outcomes in ILD patients 
      who receive statins for concomitant cardiovascular indications. Future research 
      may further elucidate the wide spectrum of pathways of IPF pathogenesis, and 
      genetic heterogeneity, identifying clinically applicable biomarkers and specific 
      endotypes thus recognizing in which patients statins could confer benefit and in 
      which they might cause detrimental effects.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many 
      genomic regions associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), the causal 
      genes and functions remain largely unknown. Many single-cell expression data have 
      become available for IPF, and there is increasing evidence suggesting a shared 
      genetic basis between IPF and other diseases. METHODS: We conducted integrative 
      analyses to improve the power of GWAS. First, we calculated global and local 
      genetic correlations to identify IPF genetically associated traits and local 
      regions. Then, we prioritised candidate genes contributing to local genetic 
      correlation. Second, we performed transcriptome-wide association analysis (TWAS) 
      of 44 tissues to identify candidate genes whose genetically predicted expression 
      level is associated with IPF. To replicate our findings and investigate the 
      regulatory role of the transcription factors (TF) in identified candidate genes, 
      we first conducted the heritability enrichment analysis in TF binding sites. 
      Then, we examined the enrichment of the TF target genes in cell-type-specific 
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified from single-cell expression data 
      of IPF and healthy lung samples. FINDINGS: We identified 12 candidate genes 
      across 13 genomic regions using local genetic correlation, including the POT1 
      locus (p value=0.00041), which contained variants with protective effects on lung 
      cancer but increasing IPF risk. We identified another 13 novel genes using TWAS. 
      Two TFs, MAFK and SMAD2, showed significant enrichment in both partitioned 
      heritability and cell-type-specific DEGs. INTERPRETATION: Our integrative 
      analysis identified new genes for IPF susceptibility and expanded the 
      understanding of the complex genetic architecture and disease mechanism of IPF.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive lung condition 
      marked by lung scarring that progresses over time and with usual interstitial 
      pneumonia histology (UIP). It is linked to a worsening cough, dyspnea, and a 
      worse quality of life. Around 3 million persons worldwide suffer from IPF, and 
      the prevalence rises sharply with advancing age. The detection of the UIP 
      pattern, generally using high-resolution CT; lung biopsy may be necessary in 
      certain individuals; the diagnostic approach also includes the elimination of 
      other interstitial lung illnesses or overlapping problems. The UIP pattern is 
      mostly bilateral, peripheral, and basal, with clusters of subpleural cystic 
      airspaces and reticular alterations linked to traction bronchiectasis. Although 
      there are still many uncertainties about how to define susceptibility, it is 
      believed that the molecular mechanisms causing IPF reflect an abnormal reparative 
      response to repeated alveolar epithelial damage in an aging genetically sensitive 
      individual. With the availability of two pharmacotherapeutic drugs, pirfenidone 
      and nintedanib, that slow physiological advancement and potentially increase 
      progression-free survival, significant progress has been made in our knowledge of 
      the clinical treatment of IPF. The goal of current research is to develop early 
      biomarkers for IPF that may include circulating variables, demographic 
      information, and imaging data.

LID - 11212
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive interstitial fibrotic 
      disease that leads to disability and death within 5 years of diagnosis. Pulmonary 
      fibrosis is a disease with a multifactorial etiology. The concept of aberrant 
      regeneration of the pulmonary epithelium reveals the pathogenesis of IPF, 
      according to which repeated damage and death of alveolar epithelial cells is the 
      main mechanism leading to the development of progressive IPF. Cell death provokes 
      the migration, proliferation and activation of fibroblasts, which overproduce 
      extracellular matrix, resulting in fibrotic deformity of the lung tissue. 
      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and extracellular vesicles (EVs) are promising 
      therapies for pulmonary fibrosis. MSCs, and EVs derived from MSCs, modulate the 
      activity of immune cells, inhibit the expression of profibrotic genes, reduce 
      collagen deposition and promote the repair of damaged lung tissue. This review 
      considers the molecular mechanisms of the development of IPF and the multifaceted 
      role of MSCs in the therapy of IPF. Currently, EVs-MSCs are regarded as a 
      promising cell-free therapy tool, so in this review we discuss the results 
      available to date of the use of EVs-MSCs for lung tissue repair.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive 
      condition with an unfavorable prognosis. A recent study has demonstrated that IPF 
      patients exhibit characteristic alterations in the fatty acid metabolism in their 
      lungs, suggesting an association with IPF pathogenesis. Therefore, in this study, 
      we have explored whether the gene signature associated with fatty acid metabolism 
      could be used as a reliable biological marker for predicting the survival of IPF 
      patients. METHODS: Data on the fatty acid metabolism-related genes (FAMRGs) were 
      extracted from databases like Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), 
      Hallmark, and Reactome pathway. The GSE70866 dataset with information on IPF 
      patients was retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Next, the 
      consensus clustering method was used to identify novel molecular subgroups. Gene 
      Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed to understand the mechanisms 
      involved. The Cell-type Identification by Estimating Relative Subsets of RNA 
      Transcripts (CIBERSORT) algorithm was used to evaluate the level of immune cell 
      infiltration in the identified subgroups based on gene expression signatures of 
      immune cells. Finally, the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator 
      (LASSO) regression and multivariate Cox regression analysis were performed to 
      develop a prognostic risk model. RESULTS: The gene expression signature 
      associated with fatty acid metabolism was used to create two subgroups with 
      significantly different prognoses. GSEA reveals that immune-related pathways were 
      significantly altered between the two subgroups, and the two subgroups had 
      different metabolic characteristics. High infiltration of immune cells, mainly 
      activated NK cells, monocytes, and activated mast cells, was observed in the 
      subgroup with a poor prognosis. A risk model based on FAMRGs had an excellent 
      ability to predict the prognosis of IPF. The nomogram constructed using the 
      clinical features and the risk model could accurately predict the prognosis of 
      IPF patients. CONCLUSION: The fatty acid metabolism-related gene expression 
      signature could be used as a potential biological marker for predicting clinical 
      outcomes and the level of infiltration of immune cells. This could eventually 
      enhance the accuracy of the treatment of IPF patients.

TI  - IL-17A promotes lung fibrosis through impairing mitochondrial homeostasis in type 
      II alveolar epithelial cells.
PG  - 5728-5741
LID - 10.1111/jcmm.17600 [doi]
AB  - The dysfunction of type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECIIs), mainly manifested 
      by apoptosis, has emerged as a major component of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
      (IPF) pathophysiology. A pivotal mechanism leading to AECIIs apoptosis is 
      mitochondrial dysfunction. Recently, interleukin (IL)-17A has been demonstrated 
      to have a pro-fibrotic role in IPF, though the mechanism is unclear. In this 
      study, we report enhanced expression of IL-17 receptor A (IL-17RA) in AECIIs in 
      lung samples of IPF patients, which may be related to the accumulation of 
      mitochondria in AECIIs of IPF. Next, we investigated this relationship in 
      bleomycin (BLM)-induced PF murine model. We found that IL-17A knockout 
      (IL-17A(-/-) ) mice exhibited decreased apoptosis levels of AECIIs. This was 
      possibly a result of the recovery of mitochondrial morphology from the improved 
      mitochondrial dynamics of AECIIs, which eventually contributed to alleviating 
      lung fibrosis. Analysis of in vitro data indicates that IL-17A impairs 
      mitochondrial function and mitochondrial dynamics of mouse primary AECIIs, 
      further promoting apoptosis. PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1)/Parkin 
      signal-mediated mitophagy is an important aspect of mitochondria homeostasis 
      maintenance. Our data demonstrate that IL-17A inhibits mitophagy and promotes 
      apoptosis of AECIIs by decreasing the expression levels of PINK1. We conclude 
      that IL-17A exerts its pro-fibrotic effects by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction 
      in AECIIs by disturbing mitochondrial dynamics and inhibiting PINK1-mediated 
      mitophagy, thereby leading to apoptosis of AECIIs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal respiratory disease 
      without effective treatments. Mitochondrial dysfunction weakens the ability of 
      mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to repair the distal lung epithelium, which is a 
      probable pathogenesis of IPF. In previous research, we found that cinnamaldehyde 
      (CA) can maintain the mitochondrial morphology of MSCs. METHODS: This present 
      study evaluated the effect and mechanism of CA on murine lung MSCs using the 
      hydrogen peroxide model. Antioxidant effects and mitochondrial function were 
      determined using flow cytometry. The mRNA levels of mitochondrial dynamics and 
      the expressions of autophagy-related proteins were also detected. RESULTS: CA can 
      increase the levels of SOD, MMP and ATP, decrease the rate of ROS and apoptosis, 
      and restore the mitochondrial structure. CA can also improve the mRNA expression 
      of MFN1, MFN2, FIS1, DRP1, OPA1, and PGC-1alpha, increase the expression of LC3 II 
      and p62 and promote the PINK1/Parkin signaling pathway. Our results demonstrated 
      that CA can control mitochondrial quality and avoid apoptosis, which may be 
      associated with the regulation of the PINK1/Parkin signaling pathway.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) can lead to the development of 
      acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In some patients with non-resolvable 
      (NR) COVID-19, lung injury can progress rapidly to the point that lung 
      transplantation is the only viable option for survival. This fatal progression of 
      lung injury involves a rapid fibroproliferative response and takes on average 15 
      weeks from initial symptom presentation. Little is known about the mechanisms 
      that lead to this fulminant lung fibrosis (FLF) in NR-COVID-19. METHODS: Using a 
      pre-designed unbiased PCR array for fibrotic markers, we analyzed the fibrotic 
      signature in a subset of NR-COVID-19 lungs. We compared the expression profile 
      against control lungs (donor lungs discarded for transplantation), and explanted 
      tissue from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Subsequently, 
      RT-qPCR, Western blots and immunohistochemistry were conducted to validate and 
      localize selected pro-fibrotic targets. A total of 23 NR-COVID-19 lungs were used 
      for RT-qPCR validation. FINDINGS: We revealed a unique fibrotic gene signature in 
      NR-COVID-19 that is dominated by a hyper-expression of pro-fibrotic genes, 
      including collagens and periostin. Our results also show a significantly 
      increased expression of Collagen Triple Helix Repeat Containing 1(CTHRC1) which 
      co-localized in areas rich in alpha smooth muscle expression, denoting 
      myofibroblasts. We also show a significant increase in cytokeratin (KRT) 5 and 8 
      expressing cells adjacent to fibroblastic areas and in areas of apparent 
      epithelial bronchiolization. INTERPRETATION: Our studies may provide insights 
      into potential cellular mechanisms that lead to a fulminant presentation of lung 
      fibrosis in NR-COVID-19. FUNDING: National Institute of Health (NIH) Grants

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) associated to idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF) portends a poor prognosis. IL-11 has been implicated in fibrotic 
      diseases, but their role on pulmonary vessels is unknown. Here we analyzed the 
      contribution of IL-11 to PH in patients with IPF and the potential mechanism 
      implicated. METHODS: Pulmonary arteries, lung tissue and serum of control 
      subjects (n = 20), IPF (n = 20) and PH associated to IPF (n = 20) were used to 
      study the expression and localization of IL-11 and IL-11Ralpha. Two models of IL-11 
      and bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis associated to PH were used in Tie2-GFP 
      transgenic mice to evaluate the contribution of IL-11 and endothelial cells to 
      pulmonary artery remodeling. The effect of IL-11 and soluble IL-11Ralpha on human 
      pulmonary artery endothelial cells and smooth muscle cell transformations and 
      proliferation were analyzed. RESULTS: IL-11 and IL-11Ralpha were over-expressed in 
      pulmonary arteries and serum of patients with PH associated to IPF vs IPF 
      patients without PH. Recombinant mice (rm)IL-11 induced lung fibrosis and PH in 
      Tie2-GFP mice, activating in vivo EnMT as a contributor of pulmonary artery 
      remodeling and lung fibrosis. Transient transfection of siRNA-IL-11 reduced lung 
      fibrosis and PH in Tie2-GFP bleomycin model. Human (h)rIL-11 and soluble 
      hrIL-11Ralpha induced endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EnMT) and pulmonary 
      artery smooth muscle cell to myofibroblast-like transformation, cell 
      proliferation and senescence in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: IL-11 and IL-11Ralpha are 
      overexpressed in pulmonary arteries of PH associated to IPF patients, and 
      contributes to pulmonary artery remodeling and PH.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a serious disease of the lung 
      parenchyma. It has a known polygenetic risk, with at least seventeen regions of 
      the genome implicated to date. Growing evidence suggests linked multimorbidity of 
      IPF with neurodegenerative or affective disorders. However, no study so far has 
      explicitly explored links between IPF, associated genetic risk profiles, and 
      specific brain features. METHODS: We exploited imaging and genetic data from more 
      than 32,000 participants available through the UK Biobank population-level 
      resource to explore links between IPF genetic risk and imaging-derived brain 
      endophenotypes. We performed a brain-wide imaging-genetics association study 
      between the presence of 17 known IPF risk variants and 1248 multi-modal 
      imaging-derived features, which characterise brain structure and function. 
      FINDINGS: We identified strong associations between cortical morphological 
      features, white matter microstructure and IPF risk loci in chromosomes 17 
      (17q21.31) and 8 (DEPTOR). Through co-localisation analysis, we confirmed that 
      cortical thickness in the anterior cingulate and more widespread white matter 
      microstructure changes share a single causal variant with IPF at the chromosome 8 
      locus. Post-hoc preliminary analysis suggested that forced vital capacity may 
      partially mediate the association between the DEPTOR variant and white matter 
      microstructure, but not between the DEPTOR risk variant and cortical thickness. 
      INTERPRETATION: Our results reveal the associations between IPF genetic risk and 
      differences in brain structure, for both cortex and white matter. Differences in 
      tissue-specific imaging signatures suggest distinct underlying mechanisms with 
      focal cortical thinning in regions with known high DEPTOR expression, unrelated 
      to lung function, and more widespread microstructural white matter changes 
      consistent with hypoxia or neuroinflammation with potential mediation by lung 
      function. FUNDING: This study was supported by the NIHR Nottingham Biomedical 
      Research Centre and the UK Medical Research Council.

TI  - VISTA (PD-1H) Is a Crucial Immune Regulator to Limit Pulmonary Fibrosis.
PG  - 22-33
LID - 10.1165/rcmb.2022-0219OC [doi]
AB  - VISTA (V domain immunoglobulin suppressor of T cell activation, also called PD-1H 
      [programmed death-1 homolog]), a novel immune regulator expressed on myeloid and 
      T lymphocyte lineages, is upregulated in mouse and human idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF). However, the significance of VISTA and its therapeutic potential 
      in regulating IPF has yet to be defined. To determine the role of VISTA and its 
      therapeutic potential in IPF, the expression profile of VISTA was evaluated from 
      human single-cell RNA sequencing data (IPF Cell Atlas). Inflammatory response and 
      lung fibrosis were assessed in bleomycin-induced experimental pulmonary fibrosis 
      models in VISTA-deficient mice compared with wild-type littermates. In addition, 
      these outcomes were evaluated after VISTA agonistic antibody treatment in the 
      wild-type pulmonary fibrosis mice. VISTA expression was increased in lung 
      tissue-infiltrating monocytes of patients with IPF. VISTA was induced in the 
      myeloid population, mainly circulating monocyte-derived macrophages, during 
      bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Genetic ablation of VISTA drastically 
      promoted pulmonary fibrosis, and bleomycin-induced fibroblast activation was 
      dependent on the interaction between VISTA-expressing myeloid cells and 
      fibroblasts. Treatment with VISTA agonistic antibody reduced fibrotic phenotypes 
      accompanied by the suppression of lung innate immune and fibrotic mediators. In 
      conclusion, these results suggest that VISTA upregulation in pulmonary fibrosis 
      may be a compensatory mechanism to limit inflammation and fibrosis, and 
      stimulation of VISTA signaling using VISTA agonists effectively limits the 
      fibrotic innate immune landscape and consequent tissue fibrosis. Further studies 
      are warranted to test VISTA as a novel therapeutic target for the IPF treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tripartite motif (TRIM) family genes get involved in the pathogenesis 
      and development of various biological processes; however, the prognostic value of 
      TRIM genes for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) needs to be explored. METHODS: 
      We acquired gene expression based on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells and 
      clinical data of three independent IPF cohorts in the GSE70866 dataset from the 
      Gene expression omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially expressed TRIM genes 
      (DETGs) between IPF patients and healthy donors were identified and used to 
      establish a risk signature by univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis 
      in the training cohort. The risk signature was further validated in other IPF 
      cohorts, and compared with previously published signatures. Moreover, we 
      performed functional enrichment analysis to explore the potential mechanisms. 
      Eventually, the quantitative real time PCR was conducted to validate the 
      expressions of the key genes in BAL from 12 IPF patients and 12 non-IPF controls 
      from our institution. RESULTS: We identified 4 DETGs including TRIM7, MEFV, 
      TRIM45 and TRIM47 significantly associated with overall survival (OS) of IPF 
      patients (P < 0.05). A multiple stepwise Cox regression analysis was performed to 
      construct a 4-TRIM-gene prognostic signature. We categorized IPF patients into 
      one low-risk group and the other high-risk group as per the average risk value of 
      the TRIM prognostic signature in the training and validation cohorts. The IPF 
      individuals in the low-risk group demonstrated an obvious OS advantage compared 
      with the high-risk one (P < 0.01). The time-dependent receiver operating 
      characteristic approach facilitated the verification of the predictive value of 
      the TRIM prognostic signature in the training and validation cohorts, compared 
      with other published signatures. A further investigation of immune cells and IPF 
      survival displayed that higher proportion of resting memory CD4+ T cells and 
      resting mast cells harbored OS advantage over lower proportion, however lower 
      proportion of neutrophils, activated dendritic cells and activated NK cells 
      indicated worse prognosis. CONCLUSION: The TRIM family genes are significant for 
      the prognosis of IPF and our signature could serve as a robust model to predict 
      OS.

      Signaling in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Fibroblasts and Transgenic Mouse 
      Models.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic human disease with persistent 
      destruction of lung parenchyma. Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) signaling 
      plays a pivotal role in the initiation and pathogenesis of IPF. As shown herein, 
      TGF-beta1 signaling down-regulated not only peroxisome biogenesis but also the 
      metabolism of these organelles in human IPF fibroblasts. In vitro cell culture 
      observations in human fibroblasts and human lung tissue indicated that 
      peroxisomal biogenesis and metabolic proteins were significantly down-regulated 
      in the lung of 1-month-old transgenic mice expressing a constitutively active 
      TGF-beta type I receptor kinase (ALK5). The peroxisome biogenesis protein 
      peroxisomal membrane protein Pex13p (PEX13p) as well as the peroxisomal lipid 
      metabolic enzyme peroxisomal acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 1 (ACOX1) and antioxidative 
      enzyme catalase were highly up-regulated in TGF-beta type II receptor and Smad3 
      knockout mice. This study reports a novel mechanism of peroxisome biogenesis and 
      metabolic regulation via TGF-beta1-Smad signaling: interaction of the Smad3 
      transcription factor with the PEX13 gene in chromatin immunoprecipitation-on-chip 
      assay as well as in a bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis model applied to TGF-beta 
      type II receptor knockout mice. Taken together, data from this study suggest that

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Excessive extra-cellular-matrix production and uncontrolled 
      proliferation of the fibroblasts are characteristics of many fibrotic diseases, 
      including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The fibroblasts have enhanced 
      glutaminolysis with up-regulated glutaminase, GLS1, which converts glutamine to 
      glutamate. Here, we investigated the role of glutaminolysis and 
      glutaminolysis-derived metabolite alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG) on IPF fibroblast 
      phenotype and gene expression. METHODS: Reduced glutamine conditions were carried 
      out either using glutamine-free culture medium or silencing the expression of 
      GLS1 with siRNA, with or without alpha-KG compensation. Cell phenotype has been 
      characterized under these different conditions, and gene expression profile was 
      examined by RNA-Seq. Specific profibrotic genes (Col3A1 and PLK1) expression were 
      examined by real-time PCR and western blots. The levels of repressive histone 
      H3K27me3, which demethylase activity is affected by glutaminolysis, were examined 
      and H3K27me3 association with promoter region of Col3A1 and PLK1 were checked by 
      ChIP assays. Effects of reduced glutaminolysis on fibrosis markers were checked 
      in an animal model of lung fibrosis. RESULTS: The lack of glutamine in the 
      culture medium alters the profibrotic phenotype of activated fibroblasts. The 
      addition of exogenous and glutaminolysis-derived metabolite alpha-KG to 
      glutamine-free media barely restores the pro-fibrotic phenotype of activated 
      fibroblasts. Many genes are down-regulated in glutamine-free medium, alpha-KG 
      supplementation only rescues a limited number of genes. As alpha-KG is a cofactor for 
      histone demethylases of H3K27me3, the reduced glutaminolysis alters H3K27me3 
      levels, and enriches H3K27me3 association with Col3A1 and PLK1 promoter region. 
      Adding alpha-KG in glutamine-free medium depleted H3K27me3 association with Col3A1 
      promoter region but not that of PLK1. In a murine model of lung fibrosis, mice 
      with reduced glutaminolysis showed markedly reduced fibrotic markers. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that glutamine is critical for supporting 
      pro-fibrotic fibroblast phenotype in lung fibrosis, partially through 
      alpha-KG-dependent and -independent mechanisms, and supports targeting fibroblast 
      metabolism as a therapeutic method for fibrotic diseases.

TI  - The Genetic and Epigenetic Footprint in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis and 
      Familial Pulmonary Fibrosis: A State-of-the-Art Review.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics12123107 [doi]
LID - 3107
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare disease of the lung with a largely 
      unknown etiology and a poor prognosis. Intriguingly, forms of familial pulmonary 
      fibrosis (FPF) have long been known and linked to specific genetic mutations. 
      There is little evidence of the possible role of genetics in the etiology of 
      sporadic IPF. We carried out a non-systematic, narrative literature review aimed 
      at describing the main known genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that are involved 
      in the pathogenesis and prognosis of IPF and FPF. In this review, we highlighted 
      the mutations in classical genes associated with FPF, including those encoding 
      for telomerases (TERT, TERC, PARN, RTEL1), which are also found in about 10-20% 
      of cases of sporadic IPF. In addition to the Mendelian forms, mutations in the 
      genes encoding for the surfactant proteins (SFTPC, SFTPA1, SFTPA2, ABCA3) and 
      polymorphisms of genes for the mucin MUC5B and the Toll-interacting protein 
      TOLLIP are other pathways favoring the fibrogenesis that have been thoroughly 
      explored. Moreover, great attention has been paid to the main epigenetic 
      alterations (DNA methylation, histone modification and non-coding RNA gene 
      silencing) that are emerging to play a role in fibrogenesis. Finally, a gaze on 
      the shared mechanisms between cancer and fibrogenesis, and future perspectives on 
      the genetics of pulmonary fibrosis have been analyzed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive 
      interstitial lung disease. Many studies suggest that autophagy may be related to 
      disease progression and prognosis in IPF. However, the mechanisms involved have 
      not been fully elucidated. METHODS: We incorporated 232 autophagy-associated 
      genes (AAGs) and two datasets, GSE28042 and GSE27957, from the GEO database. 
      Univariate Cox analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator 
      (LASSO) regression were used to construct the autophagy-associated prognostic 
      model. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) 
      analyses were performed to investigate the functions of these 
      autophagy-associated genes. CIBERSORT algorithm was used to calculate the immune 
      cell infiltration between patients in the high-risk score and low-risk score 
      groups. Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed 
      to explore the mRNA expression of five genes in the autophagy-associated risk 
      model. RESULTS: We constructed a 5-autophagy-associated genes signature based on 
      Univariate Cox analysis and LASSO regression. In our autophagy-associated risk 
      model, IPF patients in the high-risk group demonstrated a poor overall survival 
      rate compared to patients in the low-risk group. For 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival 
      rates, the AUC predictive value of the AAG signature was 0.670, 0.787, and 0.864, 
      respectively. These results were validated in the GSE27957 cohort, confirming the 
      good prognostic effect of our model. GO and KEGG pathway analyses enriched 
      immune-related pathways between the high-risk and low-risk groups. And there was 
      also a significant difference in immune cell infiltration between two groups. And 
      the results of qRT-PCR showed that the expression levels of FOXO1, IRGM, MYC, and 
      PRKCQ were significantly decreased in the Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell 
      (PBMC) of IPF patient samples. CONCLUSION: Our study constructed and validated an 
      autophagy-associated risk model based on MYC, MAPK1, IRGM, PRKCQ, and FOXO1. And 
      those five genes may influence the progression of IPF by regulating immune 
      responses and immune cells.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease with high mortality 
      and limited therapeutic options. The immune checkpoint PD1/PD-L1 axis is related 
      to the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, and upregulated expression levels of 
      PD-L1 have been demonstrated in IPF patients. However, the mechanism of PD-L1 in 
      pulmonary fibrosis is not fully understood. Here, we demonstrated upregulated 
      expression of PD-L1 in fibrotic lung tissues and sera of IPF patients. Bleomycin 
      (BLM) treatment induced PD-L1 upregulation, EMT (Epithelial-Mesenchymal 
      Transition) and fibrosis-like morphology changes in human pulmonary alveolar 
      epithelial cells (HPAEpiCs). Silencing PD-L1 attenuated BLM-induced EMT and 
      fibrosis-like morphology changes in HPAEpiCs. In addition, we identified that 
      PD-L1 directly binds to vimentin and inhibits vimentin ubiquitination, thereby 
      increasing vimentin levels in HPAEpiCs. Silencing of vimentin inhibited BLM- and 
      PD-L1-induced fibrosis in HPAEpiCs. The correlation between PD-L1 and EMT or 
      vimentin expression was further confirmed in clinical samples and animal models. 
      Finally, we used BLM- and paraquat-induced pulmonary fibrosis animal models to 
      confirm the anti-pulmonary fibrosis effects of PD-L1 silencing. Taken together, 
      our findings suggest that upregulated PD-L1 stimulates EMT of alveolar epithelial 
      cells by increasing vimentin levels by inhibiting vimentin ubiquitination, 
      thereby contributing to pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a common chronic and progressive lung 
      disease. Fibulin-2 (FBLN2) is upregulated in patients with IPF; however, its 
      exact role in IPF remains unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the 
      role and the regulatory mechanism of FBLN2 in TGF-beta1-induced fibrogenesis using 
      human lung fibroblast-derived MRC-5 cells. Cell transfection was performed to 
      regulate FBLN2 expression. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western 
      blot analyses were performed to detect the expression levels of FBLN2 and 
      vitronectin (VTN). Cell viability and migration were determined via the Cell 
      Counting Kit-8 and wound healing assays, respectively. Immunofluorescence was 
      performed to detect alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA)-positive cells. The STRING 
      database was used to predict the interaction between FBLN2 and VTN, which was 
      verified via the protein immunoprecipitation assay. The results demonstrated that 
      inhibition of FBLN2 notably inhibited TGF-beta1-induced proliferation and migration, 
      as well as downregulating the protein expression levels of MMP2 and MMP9 in MRC-5 
      cells. In addition, inhibition of FBLN2 suppressed the expression levels of 
      alpha-SMA, collagen type 1 alpha1 and fibronectin. FBLN2 was demonstrated to bind to VTN 
      and negatively regulate its expression. Furthermore, overexpression of VTN partly 
      abolished the inhibitory effects of FBLN2 knockdown on TGF-beta1-induced 
      proliferation, migration and fibrosis, as well as the activity of focal adhesion 
      kinase (FAK) signaling. Taken together, the results of the present study suggest 
      that FBLN2 knockdown can attenuate TGF-beta1-induced fibrosis in MRC-5 cells by 
      downregulating VTN expression via FAK signaling. Thus, FBLN2 may be a potential 
      therapeutic target for IPF treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the inhibiting effects of FHL2 and 
      Arbutin on cell fibrosis and their possible mechanisms. METHODS: The mRNA 
      expression of FHL2 in pulmonary fibrosis tissues was analyzed by bioinformatics. 
      TGF rectanglebeta1 induced fibrosis of mouse lung fibroblast (Mlg) and mouse primary 
      pulmonary fibroblast (PPF) in rat's lung fibroblasts. FHL2 siRNA was transfected 
      into Mlg and mouse PPF cells to inhibit FHL2. FHL2, alpha-smooth muscle actin 
      (alpha-SMA), collagen 1 (Col I), and Fibronectin (Fn) were detected by qRT-PCR. 
      Western blot expression levels of Smad3, p-Smad3, Smad2, and p-Smad2 proteins in 
      cells. High-throughput drug screening for FHL2 inhibitors and the inhibitory 
      effect of Arbutin on pulmonary fibrosis were validated in cellular and animal 
      models of pulmonary fibrosis. RESULTS: The mRNA expression of FHL2 in lung fiber 
      tissue was increased. Meanwhile, the decrease of FHL2 expression significantly 
      inhibited the cellular fibrosis morphological changes of rat's lung fibroblasts 
      (Mlgs) and primary lung fibroblasts (PPFs). The expression levels of alpha rectangleSMA, Col 
      I, and Fn were decreased. High-throughput screening showed that Arbutin targeted 
      FHL2. Arbutin alleviated bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats by 
      inhibiting FHL2 and then the TGF-beta1/Smad signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: 
      Inhibition of FHL2 can effectively reduce the fibrosis process induced by TGF rectanglebeta1 
      and bleomycin, and then inhibit the fibrosis.

AB  - Epithelial injury is one of the major drivers of acute pulmonary diseases. 
      Recurring injury followed by aberrant repair is considered as the primary cause 
      of chronic lung diseases, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). 
      Preclinical in vivo models allow studying early disease-driving mechanisms like 
      the recently established adeno-associated virus-diphtheria toxin receptor 
      (AAV-DTR) mouse model of acute epithelial lung injury, which utilises AAV 
      mediated expression of the human DTR. We performed quantitative proteomics of 
      homogenised lung samples from this model and compared the results to spatially 
      resolved proteomics data of epithelial cell regions from the same animals. In 
      whole lung tissue proteins involved in cGAS-STING and interferon pathways, 
      proliferation, DNA replication and the composition of the provisional 
      extracellular matrix were upregulated upon injury. Besides epithelial cell 
      markers SP-A, SP-C and Scgb1a1, proteins involved in cilium assembly, lipid 
      metabolism and redox pathways were among downregulated proteins. Comparison of 
      the bulk to spatially resolved proteomics data revealed a large overlap of 
      protein changes and striking differences. Together our study underpins the broad 
      usability of bulk proteomics and pinpoints to the benefit of sophisticated 
      proteomic analyses of specific tissue regions or single cell types.

TI  - alpha1 Adrenoreceptor antagonism mitigates extracellular mitochondrial DNA 
      accumulation in lung fibrosis models and in patients with idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis.
PG  - L639-L651
LID - 10.1152/ajplung.00119.2022 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is increasingly associated with nerve-driven 
      processes and endogenous innate immune ligands such as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). 
      Interestingly, a connection between these entities has not been explored. Here, 
      we report that noradrenaline (NA) derived from the lung's adrenergic nerve supply 
      drives alpha-smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA)-expressing fibroblast accumulation via 
      mechanisms involving alpha1 adrenoreceptors and mtDNA. Using the bleomycin model, we 
      compared ablation of the lung's adrenergic nerve supply with surgical adrenal 
      resection and found that NA derived from local but not adrenal sources 
      contributes to experimentally induced lung fibrosis and the emergence of an 
      alphaSMA+ve fibroblast population expressing adrenoreceptor alpha-1D (ADRA1D). 
      Therapeutic delivery of the alpha1 adrenoreceptor antagonist terazosin reversed these 
      changes and suppressed extracellular mtDNA accumulation. Cultured normal human 
      lung fibroblasts displayed alpha1 adrenoreceptors and in response to costimulation 
      with TGFbeta1 and NA adopted ACTA2 expression and extracellular mtDNA release. These 
      findings were opposed by terazosin. Evaluation of a previously studied IPF cohort 
      revealed that patients prescribed alpha1 adrenoreceptor antagonists for nonpulmonary 
      indications demonstrated improved survival and reduced concentrations of plasma 
      mtDNA. Our observations link nerve-derived NA, alpha1 adrenoreceptors, extracellular 
      mtDNA, and lung fibrogenesis in mouse models, cultured cells, and humans with 
      IPF. Further study of this neuroinnate connection may yield new avenues for 
      investigation in the clinical and basic science realms.

AB  - The most common type of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia is idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF), an irreversible, progressive disorder that has lately come into 
      question for possible associations with COVID-19. With few geographical 
      exceptions, IPF is a rare disease but its prevalence has been increasing markedly 
      since before the pandemic. Environmental exposures are frequently implicated in 
      IPF although genetic factors play a role as well. In IPF, healthy lung tissue is 
      progressively replaced with an abnormal extracellular matrix that impedes normal 
      alveolar function while, at the same time, natural repair mechanisms become 
      dysregulated. While chronic viral infections are known risk factors for IPF, 
      acute infections are not and the link to COVID-19 has not been established. 
      Macrophagy may be a frontline defense against any number of inflammatory 
      pulmonary diseases, and the inflammatory cascade that may occur in patients with 
      COVID-19 may disrupt the activity of monocytes and macrophages in clearing up 
      fibrosis and remodeling lung tissue. It is unclear if COVID-19 infection is a 
      risk factor for IPF, but the two can occur in the same patient with complicating 
      effects. In light of its increasing prevalence, further study of IPF and its 
      diagnosis and treatment is warranted.

AB  - Interstitial lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are caused 
      by persistent micro-injuries to alveolar epithelial tissues accompanied by 
      aberrant repair processes. IPF is currently treated with pirfenidone and 
      nintedanib, compounds which slow the rate of disease progression but fail to 
      target underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. The DNA repair protein 
      8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase-1 (OGG1) has significant roles in the modulation of 
      inflammation and metabolic syndromes. Currently, no pharmaceutical solutions 
      targeting OGG1 have been utilized in the treatment of IPF. In this study we show 
      Ogg1-targeting siRNA mitigates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in male mice, 
      highlighting OGG1 as a tractable target in lung fibrosis. The small molecule OGG1 
      inhibitor, TH5487, decreases myofibroblast transition and associated pro-fibrotic 
      gene expressions in fibroblast cells. In addition, TH5487 decreases levels of 
      pro-inflammatory mediators, inflammatory cell infiltration, and lung remodeling 
      in a murine model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis conducted in male 
      C57BL6/J mice. OGG1 and SMAD7 interact to induce fibroblast proliferation and 
      differentiation and display roles in fibrotic murine and IPF patient lung tissue. 
      Taken together, these data suggest that TH5487 is a potentially clinically 
      relevant treatment for IPF but further study in human trials is required.

      TGF-beta1/Smad Signaling Pathway.
PG  - 235-242
LID - 10.1007/s00408-023-00608-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive 
      interstitial lung disease characterized by excessive extracellular matrix 
      deposition. No effective treatments are currently available for IPF. 
      High-temperature requirement A3 (HtrA3) suppresses tumor development by 
      antagonizing transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling; however, little is 
      known about the role of HtrA3 in IPF. This study investigated the role of HtrA3 
      in IPF and underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Lung tissues were collected from 
      patients with IPF and mice with bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis, and 
      HtrA3 expression was measured in tissue samples. Then, HtrA3 gene knockout mice 
      were treated with BLM to induce pulmonary fibrosis and explore the effects and 
      underlying mechanism of HtrA3 on pulmonary fibrosis. RESULTS: HtrA3 was 
      up-regulated in the lung tissues of patients with IPF and the pulmonary fibrotic 
      mouse model compared to corresponding control groups. HtrA3 knockout decreased 
      pulmonary fibrosis-related protein expression, alleviated the symptoms of 
      pulmonary fibrosis, and inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in 
      BLM-induced lung tissue compared with BLM-induced wild-type mice. The TGF-beta1/Smad 
      signaling pathway was activated in fibrotic lung tissue, whereas HtrA3 knockout 
      inhibited this pathway. CONCLUSION: The expression level of HtrA3 is increased in 
      fibrotic lungs. HtrA3 knockout alleviates the symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis 
      probably via the TGF-beta1/Smad signaling pathway. Therefore, HtrA3 inhibition is a 
      potential therapeutic target for pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - The respiratory system is a well-organized multicellular organ, and disruption of 
      cellular homeostasis or abnormal tissue repair caused by genetic deficiency and 
      exposure to risk factors lead to life-threatening pulmonary disease including 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Although there is no clear etiology as the 
      name reflected, its pathological progress is closely related to uncoordinated 
      cellular and molecular signals. Here, we review the advances in our understanding 
      of the role of lung tissue cells in IPF pathology including epithelial cells, 
      mesenchymal stem cells, fibroblasts, immune cells, and endothelial cells. These 
      advances summarize the role of various cell components and signaling pathways in 
      the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, which is helpful to further 
      study the pathological mechanism of the disease, provide new opportunities for 
      disease prevention and treatment, and is expected to improve the survival rate 
      and quality of life of patients.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a severe interstitial lung disease; 
      although the recent introduction of two anti-fibrosis drugs, pirfenidone and 
      Nidanib, have resulted in a significant reduction in lung function decline, IPF 
      is still not curable. Approximately 2-20% of patients with IPF have a family 
      history of the disease, which is considered the strongest risk factor for 
      idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. However, the genetic predispositions of 
      familial IPF (f-IPF), a particular type of IPF, remain largely unknown. Genetics 
      affect the susceptibility and progression of f-IPF. Genomic markers are 
      increasingly being recognized for their contribution to disease prognosis and 
      drug therapy outcomes. Existing data suggest that genomics may help identify 
      individuals at risk for f-IPF, accurately classify patients, elucidate key 
      pathways involved in disease pathogenesis, and ultimately develop more effective 
      targeted therapies. Since several genetic variants associated with the disease 
      have been found in f-IPF, this review systematically summarizes the latest 
      progress in the gene spectrum of the f-IPF population and the underlying 
      mechanisms of f-IPF. The genetic susceptibility variation related to the disease 
      phenotype is also illustrated. This review aims to improve the understanding of 
      the IPF pathogenesis and facilitate his early detection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal lung disease with a 
      high burden of both pulmonary and extrapulmonary comorbidities. RESEARCH 
      QUESTION: Do these comorbidities have causal relationships with IPF? STUDY DESIGN 
      AND METHODS: We searched PubMed to pinpoint possible IPF-related comorbid 
      conditions. Bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) was performed using 
      summary statistics from the largest genome-wide association studies for these 
      diseases to date in a two-sample setting. Findings were verified using multiple 
      MR approaches under different model assumptions, replication datasets for IPF, 
      and secondary phenotypes. RESULTS: A total of 22 comorbidities with genetic data 
      available were included. Bidirectional MR analyses showed convincing evidence for 
      two comorbidities and suggestive evidence for four comorbidities. 
      Gastroesophageal reflux disease, VTE, and hypothyroidism were associated causally 
      with an increased risk of IPF, whereas COPD was associated causally with a 
      decreased risk of IPF. For the reverse direction, IPF showed causal associations 
      with a higher risk of lung cancer, but a reduced risk of hypertension. Follow-up 
      analyses of pulmonary function parameters and BP measures supported the causal 
      effect of COPD on IPF and the causal effect of IPF on hypertension. 
      INTERPRETATION: The present study suggested the causal associations between IPF 
      and certain comorbidities from a genetic perspective. Further research is needed 
      to understand the mechanisms of these associations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and fatal 
      disease,characterized by an excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) 
      proteins in response to chronic lung injury. Current evidence suggests that 
      metabolic reprogramming is always accompanied by myofibroblast activation in 
      IPFof whichthe underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Ring finger protein 130 
      (RNF130), was demonstrated involved in multiple diseases. However, whether RNF130 
      plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of IPF needs to be clarified. METHODS: 
      We first investigated the expression of RNF130 in pulmonary fibrosis in vivo and 
      in vitro. We then observed the effect and explored the molecular mechanism of 
      RNF130 on the transition of fibroblast to myofibroblast and aerobic glycolysis. 
      Further, we assessed the effects of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-induced RNF130 
      overexpression in the pulmonary fibrosis model, conducting pulmonary function, 
      assessment of collagen depositionusing the hydroxyproline assay, and biochemical 
      and histopathological analyses. RESULTS: We found that RNF130 was down-regulated 
      in lung tissues of mice with bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and lung 
      fibroblasts treated with transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1). Then we 
      demonstrated that RNF130 inhibitedthe transition of fibroblast to myofibroblast 
      by suppressing aerobic glycolysis. Mechanistically, we revealed that RNF130 
      promotedc-myc ubiquitination and degradation, while c-myc overexpression reverses 
      the inhibitory effects of RNF130. Importantly, pulmonary function, collagen 
      deposition and fibroblast differentiation were significantly alleviated in 
      adeno-associated virus serotype (AAV)6-RNF130 treated mice, which further 
      validated the contribution of RNF130/c-myc signaling axis in pulmonary fibrosis 
      pathological process. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, RNF130 participates in the 
      pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting the transition of fibroblast to 
      myofibroblast and aerobic glycolysis through promoting c-myc ubiquitination and 
      degradation. Targeting RNF130-c-myc axismightrepresent a promising strategy to 
      alleviate the progression of IPF.

LID - 4410
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disease characterized by 
      the aberrant accumulation of extracellular matrix in the lungs. nintedanib is one 
      of the two FDA-approved drugs for IPF treatment; however, the exact 
      pathophysiological mechanisms of fibrosis progression and response to therapy are 
      still poorly understood. In this work, the molecular fingerprint of fibrosis 
      progression and response to nintedanib treatment have been investigated by mass 
      spectrometry-based bottom-up proteomics in paraffin-embedded lung tissues from 
      bleomycin-induced (BLM) pulmonary fibrosis mice. Our proteomics results unveiled 
      that (i) samples clustered depending on the tissue fibrotic grade (mild, 
      moderate, and severe) and not on the time course after BLM treatment; (ii) the 
      dysregulation of different pathways involved in fibrosis progression such as the 
      complement coagulation cascades, advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and their 
      receptors (RAGEs) signaling, the extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, the 
      regulation of actin cytoskeleton, and ribosomes; (iii) Coronin 1A (Coro1a) as the 
      protein with the highest correlation when evaluating the progression of fibrosis, 
      with an increased expression from mild to severe fibrosis; and (iv) a total of 10 
      differentially expressed proteins (p(adj)-value </= 0.05 and Fold change </=-1.5 or 
      >/=1.5), whose abundance varied in the base of the severity of fibrosis (mild and 
      moderate), were modulated by the antifibrotic treatment with nintedanib, 
      reverting their trend. Notably, nintedanib significantly restored lactate 
      dehydrogenase B (Ldhb) expression but not lactate dehydrogenase A (Ldha). 
      Notwithstanding the need for further investigations to validate the roles of both 
      Coro1a and Ldhb, our findings provide an extensive proteomic characterization 
      with a strong relationship with histomorphometric measurements. These results 
      unveil some biological processes in pulmonary fibrosis and drug-mediated fibrosis 
      therapy.

AB  - Some recent studies showed that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) infections and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) disease might 
      stimulate each other through the shared genes. Therefore, in this study, an 
      attempt was made to explore common genomic biomarkers for SARS-CoV-2 infections 
      and IPF disease highlighting their functions, pathways, regulators and associated 
      drug molecules. At first, we identified 32 statistically significant common 
      differentially expressed genes (cDEGs) between disease (SARS-CoV-2 and IPF) and 
      control samples of RNA-Seq profiles by using a statistical r-package (edgeR). 
      Then we detected 10 cDEGs (CXCR4, TNFAIP3, VCAM1, NLRP3, TNFAIP6, SELE, MX2, 
      IRF4, UBD and CH25H) out of 32 as the common hub genes (cHubGs) by the 
      protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. The cHubGs regulatory network 
      analysis detected few key TFs-proteins and miRNAs as the transcriptional and 
      post-transcriptional regulators of cHubGs. The cDEGs-set enrichment analysis 
      identified some crucial SARS-CoV-2 and IPF causing common molecular mechanisms 
      including biological processes, molecular functions, cellular components and 
      signaling pathways. Then, we suggested the cHubGs-guided top-ranked 10 candidate 
      drug molecules (Tegobuvir, Nilotinib, Digoxin, Proscillaridin, Simeprevir, 
      Sorafenib, Torin 2, Rapamycin, Vancomycin and Hesperidin) for the treatment 
      against SARS-CoV-2 infections with IFP diseases as comorbidity. Finally, we 
      investigated the resistance performance of our proposed drug molecules compare to 
      the already published molecules, against the state-of-the-art alternatives 
      publicly available top-ranked independent receptors by molecular docking 
      analysis. Molecular docking results suggested that our proposed drug molecules 
      would be more effective compare to the already published drug molecules. Thus, 
      the findings of this study might be played a vital role for diagnosis and 
      therapies of SARS-CoV-2 infections with IPF disease as comorbidity risk.

AB  - Immune cells have been implicated in interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), although 
      their phenotypes and effector mechanisms remain poorly understood. To better 
      understand these cells, we conducted an exploratory mass cytometry analysis of 
      immune cell subsets in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from patients with 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), connective-tissue disease (CTD)-related ILD, 
      and sarcoidosis, using two panels including 64 markers. Among myeloid cells, we 
      observed the expansion of CD14(+) CD36(hi) CD84(hi)CCR2(-) monocyte populations 
      in IPF. These CD14(+) CD36(hi) CD84(hi) CCR2(-) subsets were also increased in 
      ILDs with a progressive phenotype, particularly in a case of acute exacerbation 
      (AEx) of IPF. Analysis of B cells revealed the presence of cells at various 
      stages of differentiation in BALF, with a higher percentage of IgG memory B cells 
      in CTD-ILDs and a trend toward more FCRL5(+) B cells. These FCRL5(+) B cells were 
      also present in the patient with AEx-IPF and sarcoidosis with advanced lung 
      lesions. Among T cells, we found increased levels of IL-2R(+) TIGIT(+) LAG3(+) 
      CD4(+) T cells in IPF, increased levels of CXCR3(+) CD226(+) CD4(+) T cells in 
      sarcoidosis, and increased levels of PD1(+) TIGIT(+) CD57(+) CD8(+) T cells in 
      CTD-ILDs. Together, these findings underscore the diverse immunopathogenesis of 
      ILDs.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal interstitial lung disease with an 
      unclear pathogenesis. This study aimed to elucidate the function and potential 
      mechanisms of TUG1 in IPF progression. Cell viability and migration were detected 
      by CCK-8 and transwell assays. Autophagy, fibrosis, or EMT-related proteins were 
      measured by Western blotting. Pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were assessed by 
      ELISA kits. The subcellular localization of TUG1 was observed by FISH assay. RIP 
      assay detected the interaction between TUG1 and CDC27. TUG1 and CDC27 was 
      up-regulated in TGF-beta1-induced RLE-6TN cells. TUG1 depletion suppressed pulmonary 
      fibrosis via attenuating inflammation, EMT, inducing autophagy and inactivating 
      PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in vitro and in vivo. TUG1 knockdown prevented CDC27 
      expression. TUG1 silencing ameliorated pulmonary fibrosis by reducing CDC27 
      expression and inhibiting PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.

TI  - The causal relationship between gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis: a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomisation study.
LID - 10.1183/13993003.01585-2022 [doi]
LID - 2201585
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is associated with 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in observational studies. It is not known if 
      this association arises because GORD causes IPF or because IPF causes GORD, or 
      because of confounding by factors, such as smoking, associated with both GORD and 
      IPF. We used bidirectional Mendelian randomisation (MR), where genetic variants 
      are used as instrumental variables to address issues of confounding and reverse 
      causation, to examine how, if at all, GORD and IPF are causally related. METHODS: 
      A bidirectional two-sample MR was performed to estimate the causal effect of GORD 
      on IPF risk and of IPF on GORD risk, using genetic data from the largest GORD 
      (78 707 cases and 288 734 controls) and IPF (4125 cases and 20 464 controls) 
      genome-wide association meta-analyses currently available. RESULTS: GORD 
      increased the risk of IPF, with an OR of 1.6 (95% CI 1.04-2.49; p=0.032). There 
      was no evidence of a causal effect of IPF on the risk of GORD, with an OR of 
      0.999 (95% CI 0.997-1.000; p=0.245). CONCLUSIONS: We found that GORD increases 
      the risk of IPF, but found no evidence that IPF increases the risk of GORD. GORD 
      should be considered in future studies of IPF risk and interest in it as a 
      potential therapeutic target should be renewed. The mechanisms underlying the 
      effect of GORD on IPF should also be investigated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive, 
      fibrotic interstitial lung condition with unknown etiology and high mortality. 
      Chinese herbal medicine has been used for more than a thousand years to treat 
      various lung diseases. PURPOSE: The current study aimed to examine whether 
      Chinese herbal Maxing Huoqiao Decoction (MXHQD) exerts therapeutic effects on IPF 
      and to further uncover its underlying molecular mechanisms. METHODS: Mouse model 
      of acute lung injury (ALI) or IPF was induced by intratracheal instillation of 
      LPS or bleomycin, respectively. ALI mice were treated with MXHQD for 7 days, and 
      lung tissues were taken for test after modeling 24 h. IPF mice were gavaged for 
      21 days after modeling. Lung tissues were subjected to whole transcriptome 
      detection, and the differential RNAs were experimentally verified. RESULTS: The 
      results showed that MXHQD alleviated the computed tomography (CT) and the 
      pathological degree changes in mice with IPF, improved changes in the expression 
      of fibrosis related genes and reduced the hydroxyproline expression in IPF mice. 
      MXHQD also decreased the cell numbers in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, and the 
      expression levels of the inflammatory factors in the ALI mice lung tissues were 
      significantly inhibited. By applying whole transcriptome analysis, results showed 
      that MXHQD acted on 40 mRNAs, 15 miRNAs, 25 novel lncRNAs and 17 circRNAs to 
      resist pulmonary fibrosis. The competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network diagram 
      showed that the multiple components of MXHQD against fibrosis through a network 
      of multiple targets. The differential mRNAs were mainly related to the innate 
      immune response and the defense response to virus. Then the expression of mRNAs 
      in the differential mRNA-miRNA-differential circRNA network in the lung tissue of 
      IPF was verified. The expression of ZBP1 and ISG15 related to immune system and 
      anti virus was verified at both gene and protein expressions. MXHQD could 
      significantly inhibit the elevation of ZBP1 and ISG15 factors induced by the 
      fibrosis model. CONCLUSION: Overall, our findings provide compelling evidence 
      that MXHQD can alleviate IPF by modulating innate immunity. This is the first 
      study to reveal the molecular mechanism underlying the multi-components, 
      multi-channels and multi-targets anti-IPF immune injury of MXHQD, and supports 
      its potential clinical application for IPF.

TI  - Cloning a profibrotic stem cell variant in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - eabp9528

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, irreversible, and rapidly 
      fatal interstitial lung disease marked by the replacement of lung alveoli with 
      dense fibrotic matrices. Although the mechanisms initiating IPF remain unclear, 
      rare and common alleles of genes expressed in lung epithelia, combined with 
      aging, contribute to the risk for this condition. Consistently, single-cell RNA 
      sequencing (scRNA-seq) studies have identified lung basal cell heterogeneity in 
      IPF that might be pathogenic. We used single-cell cloning technologies to 
      generate "libraries" of basal stem cells from the distal lungs of 16 patients 
      with IPF and 10 controls. We identified a major stem cell variant that was 
      distinguished from normal stem cells by its ability to transform normal lung 
      fibroblasts into pathogenic myofibroblasts in vitro and to activate and recruit 
      myofibroblasts in clonal xenografts. This profibrotic stem cell variant, which 
      was shown to preexist in low quantities in normal and even fetal lungs, expressed 
      a broad network of genes implicated in organ fibrosis and showed overlap in gene 
      expression with abnormal epithelial signatures identified in previously published 
      scRNA-seq studies of IPF. Drug screens highlighted specific vulnerabilities of 
      this profibrotic variant to inhibitors of epidermal growth factor and mammalian 
      target of rapamycin signaling as prospective therapeutic targets. This 
      profibrotic stem cell variant in IPF was distinct from recently identified 
      profibrotic stem cell variants in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and may 
      extend the notion that inappropriate accrual of minor and preexisting stem cell 
      variants contributes to chronic lung conditions.

LID - 895
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is considered the paradigmatic example of 
      chronic progressive fibrosing disease; IPF does not result from a primary 
      immunopathogenic mechanism, but immune cells play a complex role in orchestrating 
      the fibrosing response. These cells are activated by pathogen-associated or 
      danger-associated molecular patterns generating pro-fibrotic pathways or 
      downregulating anti-fibrotic agents. Post-COVID pulmonary fibrosis (PCPF) is an 
      emerging clinical entity, following SARS-CoV-2 infection; it shares many 
      clinical, pathological, and immune features with IPF. Similarities between IPF 
      and PCPF can be found in intra- and extracellular physiopathological pro-fibrotic 
      processes, genetic signatures, as well as in the response to antifibrotic 
      treatments. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection can be a cause of acute exacerbation 
      of IPF (AE-IPF), which can negatively impact on IPF patients' prognosis. In this 
      narrative review, we explore the pathophysiological aspects of IPF, with 
      particular attention given to the intracellular signaling involved in the 
      generation of fibrosis in IPF and during the SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the 
      similarities between IPF and PCPF. Finally, we focus on COVID-19 and IPF in 
      clinical practice.

AB  - Novel genetic associations for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) risk have been 
      identified. Common genetic variants associated with IPF are also associated with 
      chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis. The characterization of underlying 
      mechanisms, such as pathways involved in myofibroblast differentiation, may 
      reveal targets for future treatments. Newly identified circulating biomarkers are 
      associated with disease progression and mortality. Deep learning and machine 
      learning may increase accuracy in the interpretation of CT scans. Novel 
      treatments have shown benefit in phase 2 clinical trials. Hospitalization with 
      COVID-19 is associated with residual lung abnormalities in a substantial number 
      of patients. Inequalities exist in delivering and accessing interstitial lung 
      disease specialist care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Extensive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) in idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is due to hyperactivation and proliferation of pulmonary 
      fibroblasts. However, the exact mechanism is not clear. OBJECTIVE: This study 
      focused on the role of CTBP1 in lung fibroblast function, elaborated its 
      regulation mechanism, and analyzed the relationship between CTBP1 and ZEB1. 
      Meanwhile, the antipulmonary fibrosis effect and its molecular mechanism of 
      Toosendanin were studied. METHODS: Human IPF fibroblast cell lines (LL-97A and 
      LL-29) and normal fibroblast cell lines (LL-24) were cultured in vitro. The cells 
      were stimulated with FCS, PDGF-BB, IGF-1, and TGF-beta1, respectively. BrdU detected 
      cell proliferation. The mRNA expression of CTBP1 and ZEB1 was detected by 
      QRT-PCR. Western blotting was used to detect the expression of COL1A1, COL3A1, 
      LN, FN, and alpha-SMA proteins. An animal model of pulmonary fibrosis was established 
      to analyze the effects of CTBP1 silencing on pulmonary fibrosis and lung function 
      in mice. RESULTS: CTBP1 was up-regulated in IPF lung fibroblasts. Silencing CTBP1 
      inhibits growth factor-driven proliferation and activation of lung fibroblasts. 
      Overexpression of CTBP1 promotes growth factor-driven proliferation and 
      activation of lung fibroblasts. Silencing CTBP1 reduced the degree of pulmonary 
      fibrosis in mice with pulmonary fibrosis. Western blot, CO-IP, and BrdU assays 
      confirmed that CTBP1 interacts with ZEB1 and promotes the activation of lung 
      fibroblasts. Toosendanin can inhibit the ZEB1/CTBP1protein interaction and 
      further inhibit the progression of pulmonary fibrosis. CONCLUSION: CTBP1 can 
      promote the activation and proliferation of lung fibroblasts through ZEB1. CTBP1 
      promotes lung fibroblast activation through ZEB1, thereby increasing excessive 
      deposition of ECM and aggravating IPF. Toosendanin may be a potential treatment 
      for pulmonary fibrosis. The results of this study provide a new basis for 
      clarifying the molecular mechanism of pulmonary fibrosis and developing new 
      therapeutic targets.

AB  - Objective: To elucidate the potential causality of leukocyte telomere length 
      (LTL) with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs), we conducted a 
      Mendelian randomization (MR) study. Methods: The genetically predicted causation 
      between LTL and IMIDs was evaluated using a two-sample MR method. We analyzed 16 
      major IMIDs, which included systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), inflammatory 
      bowel disease (IBD), ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD), ankylosing 
      spondylitis (AS), sicca syndrome (SS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), type 1 diabetes 
      (T1D), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), 
      atopic dermatitis (AD), sarcoidosis, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, psoriasis, 
      and childhood asthma. The random-effects inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method 
      was performed as the main analytical approach in MR. Various sensitivity 
      analyses, including MR-Egger, MR robust adjusted profile score (MR-RAPS), 
      weighted median, MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) methods, 
      weighted mode, radial plot, and radial regression, were used to guarantee the 
      robustness of the results and detect horizontal pleiotropy. Cochran's Q value was 
      calculated to check for heterogeneity, and the MR Steiger approach was used to 
      test the causal direction. Results: The MR results indicated significant inverse 
      associations of LTL with risks of psoriasis (OR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.66-0.89, and p = 
      3.66 x 10(-4)), SS (OR: 0.75, CI: 0.58-0.98, and p = 0.03), RA (OR: 0.77, 95% CI: 
      0.68-0.88, and p = 9.85 x 10(-5)), hypothyroidism (OR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.78-0.91, 
      and p = 7,08 x 10(-6)), hyperthyroidism (OR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.44-0.83, and p = 
      1.90 x 10(-3)), sarcoidosis (OR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.54-0.83, and p = 2.60 x 10(-4)), 
      and IPF (OR: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.29-0.58, and p = 4.11 x 10(-7)) in the FinnGen 
      study. We observed that longer LTL was associated with an increased risk of AS 
      susceptibility (OR: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.18-1.94, and p = 9.66 x 10(-4)). The results 
      of the IVW method showed no causal relationship between TL and SLE (OR: 0.92, 95% 
      CI: 0.62-1.38, and p = 0.69) in the FinnGen study; however, a significantly 
      positive correlation was shown between LTL and SLE in another larger GWAS (OR: 
      1.87, 95% CI: 1.37-2.54, and p = 8.01 x 10(-5)). Conclusion: Our findings reveal 
      that abnormal LTL has the potential to increase the risk of IMIDs. Therefore, it 
      could be treated as a predictor and may provide new potential treatment targets 
      for IMIDs. However, the change of LTL may not be the direct cause of IMIDs. 
      Further studies should aim at the pathogenic mechanism or potential protective 
      effects of LTL in IMIDs.

TI  - Cuproptosis-related gene CDKN2A as a molecular target for IPF diagnosis and 
      therapeutics.
PG  - 1147-1160
LID - 10.1007/s00011-023-01739-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive chronic 
      interstitial lung disease with limited therapeutic options. Cuproptosis is a 
      recently proposed novel form of programmed cell death, which has been strongly 
      implicated in the development of various human diseases. However, the prognostic 
      and therapeutic value of cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) in IPF remains to be 
      elucidated. METHODS: In the present study, weighted gene co-expression network 
      analysis (WGCNA) was employed to identify the key CRGs associated with the 
      development of IPF. The subsequent GSEA, immune cell correlation analysis, and 
      single-cell RNA-Seq analysis were conducted to explore the potential role of the 
      identified CRGs in IPF. In addition, ROC curves and survival analysis were used 
      to assess the prognostic value of the key CRGs in IPF. Moreover, we explored the 
      molecular mechanisms of participation of identified key 
      CRGs in the development of pulmonary fibrogenesis through in vivo and 
      in vitro experiments. RESULTS: The expression level of cyclin-dependent kinase 
      inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) is upregulated in the lung tissues of IPF patients and 
      associated with disease severity. Notably, CDKN2A was constitutively expressed by 
      fibrosis-promoting M2 macrophages. Decreased CDKN2A expression sensitizes M2 
      macrophages to elesclomol-induced cuproptosis in vitro. Inhibition of CDKN2A 
      decreases the number of viable macrophages and attenuates bleomycin-induced 
      pulmonary fibrosis in mice. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that CDKN2A 
      mediates the resistance of fibrosis-promoting M2 macrophages to cuproptosis and 
      promotes pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Our work provides fresh insights into CRGs 
      in IPF with potential value for research in the pathogenesis, 
      diagnosis, and a new therapy strategy for IPF.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Myo-inositol (or inositol) and its derivatives not only function as 
      important metabolites for multiple cellular processes but also act as co-factors 
      and second messengers in signaling pathways. Although inositol supplementation 
      has been widely studied in various clinical trials, little is known about its 
      effect on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Recent studies have demonstrated 
      that IPF lung fibroblasts display arginine dependency due to loss of 
      argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1). However, the metabolic mechanisms underlying 
      ASS1 deficiency and its functional consequence in fibrogenic processes are yet to 
      be elucidated. METHODS: Metabolites extracted from primary lung fibroblasts with 
      different ASS1 status were subjected to untargeted metabolomics analysis. An 
      association of ASS1 deficiency with inositol and its signaling in lung 
      fibroblasts was assessed using molecular biology assays. The therapeutic 
      potential of inositol supplementation in fibroblast phenotypes and lung fibrosis 
      was evaluated in cell-based studies and a bleomycin animal model, respectively. 
      RESULTS: Our metabolomics studies showed that ASS1-deficient lung fibroblasts 
      derived from IPF patients had significantly altered inositol phosphate 
      metabolism. We observed that decreased inositol-4-monophosphate abundance and 
      increased inositol abundance were associated with ASS1 expression in fibroblasts. 
      Furthermore, genetic knockdown of ASS1 expression in primary normal lung 
      fibroblasts led to the activation of inositol-mediated signalosomes, including 
      EGFR and PKC signaling. Treatment with inositol significantly downregulated ASS1 
      deficiency-mediated signaling pathways and reduced cell invasiveness in IPF lung 
      fibroblasts. Notably, inositol supplementation also mitigated bleomycin-induced 
      fibrotic lesions and collagen deposition in mice. CONCLUSION: These findings 
      taken together demonstrate a novel function of inositol in fibrometabolism and 
      pulmonary fibrosis. Our study provides new evidence for the antifibrotic activity 
      of this metabolite and suggests that inositol supplementation may be a promising 
      therapeutic strategy for IPF.

TI  - Searching for Novel Candidate Small Molecules for Ameliorating Idiopathic 
      Pulmonary Fibrosis: a Narrative Review.
PG  - 484-495
LID - 10.4062/biomolther.2023.056 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) can be defined as a progressive chronic 
      pulmonary disease showing scarring in the lung parenchyma, thereby resulting in 
      increase in mortality and decrease in the quality of life. The pathophysiologic 
      mechanism of fibrosis in IPF is still unclear. Repetitive microinjuries to 
      alveolar epithelium with genetical predisposition and an abnormal restorative 
      reaction accompanied by excessive deposition of collagens are involved in the 
      pathogenesis. Although the two FDA-approved drugs, pirfenidone and nintedanib, 
      are under use for retarding the decline in lung function of patients suffered 
      from IPF, they are not able to improve the survival rate or quality of life. 
      Therefore, a novel therapeutic agent acting on the major steps of the 
      pathogenesis of disease and/or, at least, managing the clinical symptoms of IPF 
      should be developed for the effective regulation of this incurable disease. In 
      the present review, we tried to find a potential of managing the clinical 
      symptoms of IPF by natural products derived from medicinal plants used for 
      controlling the pulmonary inflammatory diseases in traditional Asian medicine. A 
      multitude of natural products have been reported to exert an antifibrotic effect 
      in vitro and in vivo through acting on the epithelial-mesenchymal transition 
      pathway, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta-induced intracellular signaling, and 
      the deposition of extracellular matrix. However, clinical antifibrotic efficacy 
      of these natural products on IPF have not been elucidated yet. Thus, those 
      effects should be proven by further examinations including the randomized 
      clinical trials, in order to develop the ideal and optimal candidate for the 
      therapeutics of IPF.

AB  - Proper lipid metabolism is crucial to maintain alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) 
      function, and excessive AEC death plays a role in the pathogenesis of idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The mRNA expression of fatty acid synthase (FASN), a 
      key enzyme in the production of palmitate and other fatty acids, is downregulated 
      in the lungs of IPF patients. However, the precise role of FASN in IPF and its 
      mechanism of action remain unclear. In this study, we showed that FASN expression 
      is significantly reduced in the lungs of IPF patients and bleomycin (BLM)-treated 
      mice. Overexpression of FASN significantly inhibited BLM-induced AEC death, which 
      was significantly potentiated by FASN knockdown. Moreover, FASN overexpression 
      reduced BLM-induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and the production 
      of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Oleic acid, a fatty acid 
      component increased by FASN overexpression, inhibited BLM-induced cell death in 
      primary murine AECs and rescue BLM induced mouse lung injury/fibrosis. FASN 
      transgenic mice exposed to BLM exhibited attenuated lung inflammation and 
      collagen deposition compared to controls. Our findings suggest that defects in 
      FASN production may be associated with the pathogenesis of IPF, especially 
      mitochondrial dysfunction, and augmentation of FASN in the lung may have 
      therapeutic potential in preventing lung fibrosis.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating and progressive pulmonary 
      disease which is characterized by epithelial cell damage and extracellular 
      collagen deposition. To date, the therapeutic options for IPF are still very 
      limited, so the relevant mechanisms need to be explored. Heat shock protein 70 
      (HSP70), which has protective versus antitumor effects on cells under stress, is 
      a member of the heat shock protein family. In the current study, qRT-PCR, western 
      blotting, immunofluorescence staining, and migration assays were used to explore 
      the Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in BEAS-2B cells. Moreover, 
      the role of GGA in the process of pulmonary fibrosis was detected by HE, Masson 
      staining, pulmonary function test and immunohistochemistry in C57BL/6 mice. Our 
      results indicated that GGA, as an inducer of HSP70, enhanced the transformation 
      of BEAS-2B cells from epithelial to mesenchymal cells through the NF-kappaB/NOX4/ROS 
      (reactive oxygen species) signalling pathway and could significantly reduce 
      apoptosis of BEAS-2B cells induced by TGF-beta1(Transforming growth factor beta1) in 
      vitro. In vivo studies demonstrated that HSP70-inducing drugs, such as GGA, 
      attenuated pulmonary fibrosis progression induced by bleomycin (BLM). 
      Collectively, these results suggested that overexpression of HSP70 attenuated 
      pulmonary fibrosis induced by BLM in C57BL/6 mice and EMT process induced by 
      TGF-beta1 through NF-kappaB/NOX4/ROS pathway in vitro. Thus, HSP70 might be a potential 
      therapeutic strategy for human lung fibrosis.

TI  - hucMSCs treatment prevents pulmonary fibrosis by reducing 
      circANKRD42-YAP1-mediated mechanical stiffness.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fibrosing interstitial pneumonia of 
      unknown cause. The most typical characteristic of IPF is gradual weakening of 
      pulmonary elasticity and increase in hardness/rigidity with aging. This study 
      aims to identify a novel treatment approach for IPF and explore mechanism of 
      mechanical stiffness underlying human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells 
      (hucMSCs) therapy. Target ability of hucMSCs was examined by labeling with cell 
      membrane dye Dil. Anti-pulmonary fibrosis effect of hucMSCs therapy by reducing 
      mechanical stiffness was evaluated by lung function analysis and MicroCT imaging 
      system and atomic force microscope in vivo and in vitro. Results showed that 
      stiff environment of fibrogenesis caused cells to establish a mechanical 
      connection between cytoplasm and nucleus, initiating expression of related 
      mechanical genes such as Myo1c and F-actin. HucMSCs treatment blocked force 
      transmission and reduced mechanical force. For further exploration of mechanism, 
      ATGGAG was mutated to CTTGCG (the binding site of miR-136-5p) in the full-length 
      sequence of circANKRD42. Wildtype and mutant plasmids of circANKRD42 were 
      packaged into adenovirus vectors and sprayed into lungs of mice. Mechanistic 
      dissection revealed that hucMSCs treatment repressed circANKRD42 reverse splicing 
      biogenesis by inhibiting hnRNP L, which in turn promoted miR-136-5p binds to 
      3'-Untranslated Region (3'-UTR) of YAP1 mRNA directly, thus inhibiting 
      translation of YAP1 and reducing YAP1 protein entering nucleus. The condition 
      repressed expression of related mechanical genes to block force transmission and 
      reduce mechanical forces. The mechanosensing mechanism mediated directly by 
      circANKRD42-YAP1 axis in hucMSCs treatment, which has potential general 
      applicability in IPF treatment.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Genetics contributes substantially to the susceptibility to 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Genetic studies in sporadic and familial 
      disease have identified several IPF-associated variants, mainly in 
      telomere-related and surfactant protein genes.Here, we review the most recent 
      literature on genetics of IPF and discuss how it may contribute to disease 
      pathogenesis. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies implicate genes involved in 
      telomere maintenance, host defence, cell growth, mammalian target of rapamycin 
      signalling, cell-cell adhesion, regulation of TGF-beta signalling and spindle 
      assembly as biological processes involved in the pathogenesis of IPF. Both common 
      and rare genetic variants contribute to the overall risk of IPF; however, while 
      common variants (i.e. polymorphisms) account for most of the heritability of 
      sporadic disease, rare variants (i.e. mutations), mainly in telomere-related 
      genes, are the main contributors to the heritability of familial disease. Genetic 
      factors are likely to also influence disease behaviour and prognosis. Finally, 
      recent data suggest that IPF shares genetic associations - and probably some 
      pathogenetic mechanisms - with other fibrotic lung diseases. SUMMARY: Common and 
      rare genetic variants are associated with susceptibility and prognosis of IPF. 
      However, many of the reported variants fall in noncoding regions of the genome 
      and their relevance to disease pathobiology remains to be elucidated.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, relentless, and deadly 
      disease. Little is known about its pathogenetic mechanisms; therefore, developing 
      efficient pharmacological therapies is challenging. This work aimed to apply a 
      therapeutic alternative using immunomodulatory peptides in a chronic pulmonary 
      fibrosis murine model. BALB/c mice were intratracheally instilled with bleomycin 
      (BLM) and followed for 30 days. The mice were treated with the immune modulatory 
      peptides ToAP3 and ToAP4 every three days, starting on the 5th day post-BLM 
      instillation. ELISA, qPCR, morphology, and respiratory function analyses were 
      performed. The treatment with both peptides delayed the inflammatory process 
      observed in the non-treated group, which showed a fibrotic process with 
      alterations in the production of collagen I, III, and IV that were associated 
      with significant alterations in their ventilatory mechanics. The ToAP3 and ToAP4 
      treatments, by lung gene modulation patterns, indicated that distinct mechanisms 
      determine the action of peptides. Both peptides controlled the experimental IPF, 
      maintaining the tissue characteristics and standard function properties and 
      regulating fibrotic-associated cytokine production. Data obtained in this work 
      show that the immune response regulation by ToAP3 and ToAP4 can control the 
      alterations that cause the fibrotic process after BLM instillation, making both 
      peptides potential therapeutic alternatives and/or adjuvants for IPF.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most frequent and severe idiopathic 
      interstitial pneumonia. It is a chronic and progressive disease with a poor 
      prognosis and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. This disease has no 
      cure; therefore, there is a clinical need to search for alternative treatments 
      with greater efficacy. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of 
      extracellular vesicles (EVs) from Zingiber officinale (EVZO) in a murine model of 
      bleomycin (BLM)-induced IPF administered through an osmotic minipump. EVZO had an 
      average size of 373 nm and a spherical morphology, as identified by scanning 
      electron microscopy. Label-free proteomic analysis of EVZOs was performed by 
      liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, and 20 proteins were 
      identified. In addition, we demonstrated the protease activity of EVZO by 
      gelatin-degrading zymography assay and the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity of 
      EVZO by an enzymatic assay. In the BLM-induced IPF mouse model, nasal 
      administration of 50 mug of EVZO induced recovery of alveolar space size and 
      decreased cellular infiltrate, collagen deposition, and expression of 
      alpha-SMA-positive cells. Additionally, EVZO inhibited inflammatory markers such as 
      iNOS and COX-2, lipid peroxidation, and apoptotic cells. These results show that 
      EVZO may represent a novel natural delivery mechanism to treat IPF.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, fatal, fibrotic, interstitial 
      lung disease of unknown cause. Despite extensive studies, the underlying 
      mechanisms of IPF development remain unknown. Here, we found that p300 was 
      upregulated in multiple epithelial cells in lung samples from patients with IPF 
      and mouse models of lung fibrosis. Lung fibrosis was significantly diminished by 
      the alveolar type II (ATII) cell-specific deletion of the p300 gene. Moreover, we 
      found that ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L3 (UCHL3)-mediated deubiquitination of 
      p300 led to the transcriptional activation of the chemokines Ccl2, Ccl7, and 
      Ccl12 through the cooperative action of p300 and C/EBPbeta, which consequently 
      promoted M2 macrophage polarization. Selective blockade of p300 activity in ATII 
      cells resulted in the reprogramming of M2 macrophages into antifibrotic 
      macrophages. These findings demonstrate a pivotal role for p300 in the 
      development of lung fibrosis and suggest that p300 could serve as a promising 
      target for IPF treatment.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive fibrotic disease of 
      the lung with poor prognosis. Fibrosis results from remodeling of the 
      interstitial tissue. A wide range of gene expression changes are observed, but 
      the role of micro RNAs (miRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNA) is still unclear. 
      Therefore, this study aimed to establish an messenger RNA (mRNA)-miRNA-circRNA 
      competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory network to uncover novel molecular 
      signatures using systems biology tools. Six datasets were used to determine 
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and miRNAs (DEmiRNA). Accordingly, 
      protein-protein, mRNA-miRNA, and miRNA-circRNA interactions were constructed. 
      Modules were determined and further analyzed in the Drug Gene Budger platform to 
      identify potential therapeutic compounds. We uncovered common 724 DEGs and 278 
      DEmiRNAs. In the protein-protein interaction network, TMPRSS4, ESR2, TP73, 
      CLEC4E, and TP63 were identified as hub protein coding genes. The mRNA-miRNA 
      interaction network revealed two modules composed of ADRA1A, ADRA1B, hsa-miR-484 
      and CDH2, TMPRSS4, and hsa-miR-543. The DEmiRNAs in the modules further analyzed 
      to propose potential circRNA regulators in the ceRNA network. These results help 
      deepen the understanding of the mechanisms of IPF. In addition, the molecular 
      leads reported herein might inform future innovations in diagnostics and 
      therapeutics research and development for IPF.

AB  - Epigenetics indicates that certain phenotypes of an organism can undergo 
      heritable changes in the absence of changes in the genetic DNA sequence. Many 
      studies have shown that epigenetic patterns play an important role in the lung 
      and lung diseases. Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is also a type of lung disease. PF is 
      an end-stage change of a large group of lung diseases, characterized by 
      fibroblast proliferation and massive accumulation of extracellular matrix, 
      accompanied by inflammatory injury and histological destruction, that is, 
      structural abnormalities caused by abnormal repair of normal alveolar tissue. It 
      causes loss of lung function in patients with multiple complex diseases, leading 
      to respiratory failure and subsequent death. However, current treatment options 
      for IPF are very limited and no drugs have been shown to significantly prolong 
      the survival of patients. Therefore, based on a systematic understanding of the 
      disease mechanisms of PF, this review integrates the role of epigenetics in the 
      development and course of PF, describes preventive and potential therapeutic 
      targets for PF, and provides a theoretical basis for further exploration of the 
      mechanisms of PF.

AB  - AIMS: To decipher the underlying mechanisms of Sanleng-Ezhu for the treatment of 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis based on network pharmacology and single-cell RNA 
      sequencing data. BACKGROUND: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is the most 
      common type of interstitial lung disease. Although the combination of herbs 
      Sanleng (SL) and Ezhu (EZ) has shown reliable efficacy in the management of IPF, 
      its underlying mechanisms remain unknown. METHODS: Based on LC-MS/MS analysis and 
      the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis 
      Platform (TCMSP) database, we identified the bioactive components of SL-EZ. After 
      obtaining the IPF-related dataset GSE53845 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) 
      database, we performed the differential expression analysis and the weighted gene 
      co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), respectively. We obtained lowly and 
      highly expressed IPF subtype gene sets by comparing Differentially Expressed 
      Genes (DEGs) with the most significantly negatively and positively related IPF 
      modules in WGCNA. Subsequently, we performed Gene Ontology (GO), and Kyoto 
      Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses on IPF subtype gene 
      sets. The low- and highexpression MCODE subgroup feature genes were identified by 
      the MCODE plug-in and were adopted for Disease Ontology (DO), GO, and KEGG 
      enrichment analyses. Next, we performed the immune cell infiltration analysis of 
      the MCODE subgroup feature genes. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis 
      demonstrated the cell types which expressed different MCODE subgroup feature 
      genes. Molecular docking and animal experiments validated the effectiveness of 
      SL-EZ in delaying the progression of pulmonary fibrosis. RESULTS: We obtained 5 
      bioactive components of SL-EZ as well as their corresponding 66 candidate 
      targets. After normalizing the samples of the GSE53845 dataset from the GEO 
      database source, we obtained 1907 DEGs of IPF. Next, we performed a WGCNA 
      analysis on the dataset and got 11 modules. Notably, we obtained 2 IPF subgroups 
      by contrasting the most significantly up- and down-regulated modular genes in IPF 
      with DEGs, respectively. The different IPF subgroups were compared with 
      drugcandidate targets to obtain direct targets of action. After constructing the 
      protein interaction networks between IPF subgroup genes and drug candidate 
      targets, we applied the MCODE plug-in to filter the highest-scoring MCODE 
      components. DO, GO, and KEGG enrichment analyses were applied to drug targets, 
      IPF subgroup genes, and MCODE component signature genes. In addition, we 
      downloaded the single-cell dataset GSE157376 from the GEO database. By performing 
      quality control and dimensionality reduction, we clustered the scattered primary 
      sample cells into 11 clusters and annotated them into 2 cell subtypes. Drug 
      sensitivity analysis suggested that SL-EZ acts on different cell subtypes in IPF 
      subgroups. Molecular docking revealed the mode of interaction between targets and 
      their corresponding components. Animal experiments confirmed the efficacy of 
      SL-EZ. CONCLUSION: We found SL-EZ acted on epithelial cells mainly through the 
      calcium signaling pathway in the lowly-expressed IPF subtype, while in the 
      highly-expressed IPF subtype, SL-EZ acted on smooth muscle cells mainly through 
      the viral infection, apoptosis, and p53 signaling pathway.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is often accompanied by a common 
      extra-articular manifestation known as RA-related usual interstitial pneumonia 
      (RA-UIP), which is associated with a poor prognosis. However, the mechanism 
      remains unclear. To identify potential mechanisms, we conducted bioinformatics 
      analysis based on high-throughput sequencing of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) 
      database. RESULTS: Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) analysis 
      identified 2 RA-positive related modules and 4 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
      (IPF)-positive related modules. A total of 553 overlapped differentially 
      expressed genes (DEG) were obtained, of which 144 in the above modules were 
      further analyzed. The biological process of "oxidative phosphorylation" was found 
      to be the most relevant with both RA and IPF. Additionally, 498 up-regulated 
      genes in lung tissues of RA-UIP were screened out and enriched by 7 clusters, of 
      which 3 were closely related to immune regulation. The analysis of immune 
      infiltration showed a characteristic distribution of peripheral immune cells in 
      RA-UIP, compared with IPF-UIP in lung tissues. CONCLUSIONS: These results 
      describe the complex molecular and functional landscape of RA-UIP, which will 
      help illustrate the molecular pathological mechanism of RA-UIP and identify new 
      biomarkers and therapeutic targets for RA-UIP in the future.

AB  - Despite intensive studies during the last 3 years, the pathology and underlying 
      molecular mechanism of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remain poorly defined. 
      In this study, we investigated the spatial single-cell molecular and cellular 
      features of postmortem COVID-19 lung tissues using in situ sequencing (ISS). We 
      detected 10 414 863 transcripts of 221 genes in whole-slide tissues and segmented 
      them into 1 719 459 cells that were mapped to 18 major parenchymal and immune 
      cell types, all of which were infected by SARS-CoV-2. Compared with the 
      non-COVID-19 control, COVID-19 lungs exhibited reduced alveolar cells (ACs) and 
      increased innate and adaptive immune cells. We also identified 19 differentially 
      expressed genes in both infected and uninfected cells across the tissues, which 
      reflected the altered cellular compositions. Spatial analysis of local infection 
      rates revealed regions with high infection rates that were correlated with high 
      cell densities (HIHD). The HIHD regions expressed high levels of SARS-CoV-2 
      entry-related factors including ACE2, FURIN, TMPRSS2 and NRP1, and co-localized 
      with organizing pneumonia (OP) and lymphocytic and immune infiltration, which 
      exhibited increased ACs and fibroblasts but decreased vascular endothelial cells 
      and epithelial cells, mirroring the tissue damage and wound healing processes. 
      Sparse nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF) analysis of niche features 
      identified seven signatures that captured structure and immune niches in COVID-19 
      tissues. Trajectory inference based on immune niche signatures defined two 
      pathological routes. Trajectory A primarily progressed with increased NK cells 
      and granulocytes, likely reflecting the complication of microbial infections. 
      Trajectory B was marked by increased HIHD and OP, possibly accounting for the 
      increased immune infiltration. The OP regions were marked by high numbers of 
      fibroblasts expressing extremely high levels of COL1A1 and COL1A2. Examination of 
      single-cell RNA-seq data (scRNA-seq) from COVID-19 lung tissues and idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) identified similar cell populations consisting mainly of 
      myofibroblasts. Immunofluorescence staining revealed the activation of IL6-STAT3 
      and TGF-beta-SMAD2/3 pathways in these cells, likely mediating the upregulation of 
      COL1A1 and COL1A2 and excessive fibrosis in the lung tissues. Together, this 
      study provides a spatial single-cell atlas of cellular and molecular signatures 
      of fatal COVID-19 lungs, which reveals the complex spatial cellular 
      heterogeneity, organization, and interactions that characterized the COVID-19 
      lung pathology.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive respiratory 
      disease. Arguably, the complex interplay between immune cell subsets, coupled 
      with an incomplete understanding of disease pathophysiology, has hindered the 
      development of successful therapies. Despite efforts to understand its 
      pathophysiology and develop effective treatments, IPF remains a fatal disease, 
      necessitating the exploration of new treatment options. Mesenchymal stromal/stem 
      cell (MSC) therapy has shown promise in experimental models of IPF, but further 
      investigation is needed to understand its therapeutic effect. This study aimed to 
      assess the therapeutic effect of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells in a 
      bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis model. First, MSC cells were obtained from 
      mice and characterized using flow cytometry and cell differentiation culture 
      methods. Then adult C57BL/6 mice were exposed to endotracheal instillation of 
      bleomycin and concurrently treated with MSCs for reversal models on day 14. 
      Experimental groups were evaluated on days 14, 21, or 28. Additionally, lung 
      fibroblasts challenged with TGF-beta1 were treated with MSCs supernatant or MSCs to 
      explore the mechanisms underlying of pulmonary fibrosis reversal. Mesenchymal 
      stem cells were successfully isolated from mouse adipose tissue and characterized 
      based on their differentiation ability and cell phenotype. The presence of MSCs 
      or their supernatant stimulated the proliferation and migration of lung fibrotic 
      cells. MSCs supernatant reduced lung collagen deposition, improved the Ashcroft 
      score and reduced the gene and protein expression of lung fibrosis-related 
      substances. Bleomycin-challenged mice exhibited severe septal thickening and 
      prominent fibrosis, which was effectively reversed by MSCs treatment. MSC 
      supernatant could suppress the TGF-beta1/Smad signaling pathway and supernatant 
      promotes fibroblast autophagy. In summary, this study demonstrates that MSCs 
      supernatant treatment is as effective as MSCs in revert the core features of 
      bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. The current study has demonstrated that 
      MSCs supernatant alleviates the BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis in vivo. In vitro 
      experiments further reveal that MSC supernatant could suppress the TGF-beta1/Smad 
      signaling pathway to inhibit the TGF-beta1-induced fibroblast activation, and 
      promotes fibroblast autophagy by Regulating p62 expression. These findings 
      contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting the therapeutic application 
      of MSCs in cell therapy medicine for IPF.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronically progressive 
      fibrotic pulmonary disease characterized by an uncertain etiology, a poor 
      prognosis, and a paucity of efficacious treatment options. Dexmedetomidine (Dex), 
      an anesthetic-sparing alpha-2 adrenoceptor (alpha2AR) agonist, plays a crucial role 
      in organ injury and fibrosis. However, the underlying mechanisms of IPF remain 
      unknown. METHODS: In our study, the role of Dex in murine pulmonary fibrosis 
      models was determined by Dex injection intraperitoneally in vivo. Fibroblast 
      activation and myofibroblast differentiation were assessed after Dex treatment in 
      vitro. The activation of MAPK pathway and the expression of Adenosine A2B 
      receptor (ADORA2B) were examined in lung myofibroblasts. Moreover, the role of 
      ADORA2B in Dex suppressing myofibroblast differentiation and pulmonary fibrosis 
      was determined using the ADORA2B agonist BAY60-6583. RESULTS: The results 
      revealed that Dex could inhibit Bleo-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. In vitro 
      studies revealed that Dex suppressed TGF-beta-mediated MAPK pathway activation and 
      myofibroblast differentiation. Furthermore, Dex inhibits myofibroblast 
      differentiation and pulmonary fibrosis via downregulating ADORA2B expression. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest Dex as a potential therapeutic agent for 
      pulmonary fibrosis. Dex may alleviate lung fibrosis and myofibroblast 
      differentiation through the ADORA2B-mediated MAPK signaling pathway.

AB  - The molecular etiology of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has been 
      extensively investigated to identify new therapeutic targets. Although 
      anti-inflammatory treatments are not effective for patients with IPF, damaged 
      alveolar epithelial cells play a critical role in lung fibrogenesis. Here, we 
      establish an organoid-based lung fibrosis model using mouse and human lung 
      tissues to assess the direct communication between damaged alveolar type II 
      (AT2)-lineage cells and lung fibroblasts by excluding immune cells. Using this in 
      vitro model and mouse genetics, we demonstrate that bleomycin causes DNA damage 
      and activates p53 signaling in AT2-lineage cells, leading to AT2-to-AT1 
      transition-like state with a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). 
      Among SASP-related factors, TGF-beta plays an exclusive role in promoting lung 
      fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation. Moreover, the autocrine 
      TGF-beta-positive feedback loop in AT2-lineage cells is a critical cellular system 
      in non-inflammatory lung fibrogenesis. These findings provide insights into the 
      mechanism of IPF and potential therapeutic targets.

AB  - AIMS: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a severe pulmonary interstitial 
      pneumonia. Our study focuses on the role of PLA2 enzyme in the IPF to explore a 
      more effective diagnosis and treatment mechanism of IPF. MAIN METHODS: 
      Transcriptome data of IPF from GEO database and bleomycin-induced pulmonary 
      fibrosis mice were analyzed to identify PLA2 enzyme and their metabolite, 
      lysophosphatidylcholines 18:0, in IPF. Based on PLA2G2A and PLA2G2D / 
      PLA2G2A-associated cell death genes (PCDs), the consensus clustering analysis was 
      used to identify the subtypes of IPF and the correlation between PLA2G2A and 
      prognosis was analyzed. The machine learning (ML) models and artificial neural 
      network (ANN) model was used to validate the diagnostic accuracy of PLA2s and 
      PCDs in diagnosing IPF. The gene and protein expression of NLRP3, GSDMD, and 
      CASP-1 was estimated in recombinant PLA2G2A protein induced MLE-12 cells. KEY 
      FINDINGS: The expression of PLA2G2D, PLA2G2A, and LPC18 significantly changed in 
      IPF. Furtherly, PLA2G2A has a significant correlation with poor patient 
      prognosis, which could predict the 2 or 3-years mortality rates of IPF. Two 
      subtypes of IPF patients, identified based on PCDs, showed significant different 
      immunoinfiltration. Recombinant PLA2G2A protein could induce the pyrotosis in the 
      MLE-12 cell. The generalized linear model and ANN model of PLA2s or PCDs accurate 
      diagnosis IPF. SIGNIFICANCE: PLA2G2A is the most robustly associated gene with 
      IPF among the PLA2s, which demonstrates a potential in diagnosing and prognostic 
      value in IPF, and provides a foundation for further understanding and 
      breakthroughs in IPF diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal interstitial lung disease of 
      unknown etiology with a poor prognosis. It is a chronic and progressive disease 
      that has a distinct radiological and pathological pattern from common 
      interstitial pneumonia. The use of immunosuppressive medication was shown to be 
      completely ineffective in clinical trials, resulting in years of neglect of the 
      immune component. However, recent developments in fundamental and translational 
      science demonstrate that immune cells play a significant regulatory role in IPF, 
      and macrophages appear to be among the most crucial. These highly plastic cells 
      generate multiple growth factors and mediators that highly affect the initiation 
      and progression of IPF. In this review, we will provide an update on the role of 
      macrophages in IPF through a systemic discussion of various regulatory mechanisms 
      involving immune receptors, cytokines, metabolism, and epigenetics.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive lung disease, but 
      its pathogenesis is still unclear. Bioinformatics methods were used to explore 
      the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and to elucidate the pathogenesis of 
      IPF at the genetic level. The microarray datasets GSE110147 and GSE53845 were 
      downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and analyzed using 
      GEO2R to obtain the DEGs. The DEGs were further analyzed for Gene Ontology (GO) 
      and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment using the DAVID 
      database. Then, using the STRING database and Cytoscape, a protein-protein 
      interaction (PPI) network was created and the hub genes were selected. In 
      addition, lung tissue from a mouse model was validated. Lastly, the network 
      between the target microRNAs (miRNAs) and the hub genes was constructed with 
      NetworkAnalyst. A summary of 240 genes were identified as DEGs, and functional 
      analysis highlighted their role in cell adhesion molecules and ECM-receptor 
      interactions in IPF. In addition, eight hub genes were selected. Four of these 
      hub genes (VCAM1, CDH2, SPP1, and POSTN) were screened for animal validation. The 
      IHC and RT-qPCR of lung tissue from a mouse model confirmed the results above. 
      Then, miR-181b-5p, miR-4262, and miR-155-5p were predicted as possible key 
      miRNAs. Eight hub genes may play a key role in the development of IPF. Four of 
      the hub genes were validated in animal experiments. MiR-181b-5p, miR-4262, and 
      miR-155-5p may be involved in the pathophysiological processes of IPF by 
      interacting with hub genes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is increasingly recognized as a 
      chronic, progressive and fatal lung disease with an unknown etiology. Current 
      studies focus on revealing the genetic factors in the risk of IPF, making the 
      integrative analysis of genetic variations and transcriptomic alterations of 
      substantial value. AIM: This study aimed to improve the understanding of the 
      molecular basis of IPF through an integrative analysis of whole-exome sequencing 
      (WES), bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) 
      data. METHODS: WES is a powerful tool for studying the genetic basis of IPF, 
      allowing for the identification of genetic variants that may be associated with 
      the development of the disease. RNA-seq data provide a comprehensive view of the 
      transcriptional changes in IPF patients, while scRNA-seq data offer a more 
      granule view of cell-type-specific alterations. RESULTS: In this study, we 
      identified a comprehensive mutational landscape of recurrent genomic and 
      transcriptomic variations, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms, CNVs and 
      differentially expressed genes, in IPF populations, which may play a significant 
      role in the development and progression of IPF. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provided 
      valuable insights into the genetic and transcriptomic variations associated with 
      IPF, revealing changes in gene expression that may contribute to disease 
      development and progression. These findings highlight the importance of an 
      integrative approach to understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying IPF and 
      may pave the way for identifying potential therapeutic targets.

AB  - Pulmonary fibrosis results from a plethora of abnormal pathogenetic events. In 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), inhalational, environmental, or occupational 
      exposures in genetically and epigenetically predisposed individuals trigger 
      recurrent cycles of alveolar epithelial cell injury, activation of coagulation 
      pathways, chemoattraction, and differentiation of monocytes into monocyte-derived 
      alveolar macrophages (Mo-AMs). When these events happen intermittently and 
      repeatedly throughout the individual's life cycle, the wound repair process 
      becomes aberrant leading to bronchiolization of distal air spaces, fibroblast 
      accumulation, extracellular matrix deposition, and loss of the alveolar-capillary 
      architecture. The role of immune dysregulation in IPF pathogenesis and 
      progression has been underscored in the past mainly after the disappointing 
      results of immunosuppressant use in IPF patients; however, recent reports 
      highlighting the prognostic and mechanistic roles of monocytes and Mo-AMs revived 
      the interest in immune dysregulation in IPF. In this review, we will discuss the 
      role of these cells in the onset and progression of IPF, as well as potential 
      targeted therapies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) bears high mortality due to 
      unclear pathogenesis and limited therapeutic options. Therefore, identifying 
      novel regulators is required to develop alternative therapeutic strategies. 
      METHODS: The lung fibroblasts from IPF patients and Reticulocalbin 3 (RCN3) 
      fibroblast-selective knockdown mouse model were used to determine the importance 
      of Rcn3 in IPF; the epigenetic analysis and protein interaction assays, including 
      BioID, were used for mechanistic studies. RESULTS: Reticulocalbin 3 (RCN3) 
      upregulation is associated with the fibrotic activation of lung fibroblasts from 
      IPF patients and Rcn3 overexpression blunts the antifibrotic effects of 
      pirfenidone and nintedanib. Moreover, repressing Rcn3 expression in mouse 
      fibroblasts ameliorates bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis and pulmonary dysfunction 
      in vivo. Mechanistically, RCN3 promotes fibroblast activation by maintaining 
      persistent activation of TGFbeta1 signalling via the TGFbeta1-RCN3-TGFBR1 positive 
      feedback loop, in which RCN3 upregulated by TGFbeta1 exposure detains EZH2 (an 
      epigenetic methyltransferase) in the cytoplasm through RCN3-EZH2 interaction, 
      leading to the release of the EZH2-H3K27me3 epigenetic repression of TGFBR1 and 
      the persistent expression of TGFBR1. CONCLUSIONS: These findings introduce a 
      novel regulating mechanism of TGFbeta1 signalling in fibroblasts and uncover a 
      critical role of the RCN3-mediated loop in lung fibrosis. RCN3 upregulation may 
      cause resistance to IPF treatment and targeting RCN3 could be a novel approach to 
      ameliorate pulmonary fibrosis.

TI  - Beyond epithelial damage: vascular and endothelial contributions to idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis.
LID - 10.1172/JCI172058 [doi]
LID - e172058
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive scarring disease of the lung 
      with poor survival. The incidence and mortality of IPF are rising, but treatment 
      remains limited. Currently, two drugs can slow the scarring process but often at 
      the expense of intolerable side effects, and without substantially changing 
      overall survival. A better understanding of mechanisms underlying IPF is likely 
      to lead to improved therapies. The current paradigm proposes that repetitive 
      alveolar epithelial injury from noxious stimuli in a genetically primed 
      individual is followed by abnormal wound healing, including aberrant activity of 
      extracellular matrix-secreting cells, with resultant tissue fibrosis and 
      parenchymal damage. However, this may underplay the importance of the vascular 
      contribution to fibrogenesis. The lungs receive 100% of the cardiac output, and 
      vascular abnormalities in IPF include (a) heterogeneous vessel formation 
      throughout fibrotic lung, including the development of abnormal dilated vessels 
      and anastomoses; (b) abnormal spatially distributed populations of endothelial 
      cells (ECs); (c) dysregulation of endothelial protective pathways such as 
      prostacyclin signaling; and (d) an increased frequency of common vascular and 
      metabolic comorbidities. Here, we propose that vascular and EC abnormalities are 
      both causal and consequential in the pathobiology of IPF and that fuller 
      evaluation of dysregulated pathways may lead to effective therapies and a cure 
      for this devastating disease.

AB  - This study discusses the role played by long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) SOX2OT 
      (SOX2OT) in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). By inducing human embryonic lung 
      fibroblasts (MRC5) through hypoxia, the researchers observed changes in SOX2OT 
      expression and fibrotic processes during hypoxia. Moreover, SOX2OT abnormal 
      expression vectors were constructed and transfected into MRC5 to analyze the 
      effect of SOX2OT on MRC5. The results showed that the expression levels of SOX2OT 
      and alpha-SMA were elevated under hypoxic conditions and were positively correlated 
      (P<0.05). alpha-SMA, Collagen I and Collagen III protein expression and SOX2OT levels 
      all increased under hypoxia (P<0.05). Finally, silencing SOX2OT expression led to 
      weakened MRC5 proliferation, inhibited fibrosis process, and reduced inflammation 
      (P<0.05). In conclusion, SOX2OT is closely related to the occurrence and 
      development of IPF, and silencing its expression can inhibit fibrosis 
      progression.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive lung disease 
      with no known cure, characterized by the formation of scar tissue in the lungs, 
      leading to respiratory failure. Although the exact cause of IPF remains unclear, 
      the condition is thought to result from a combination of genetic and 
      environmental factors. One of the most widely used animal models to study IPF is 
      the bleomycin-induced lung injury model in mice. In this model, the 
      administration of the chemotherapeutic agent bleomycin causes pulmonary 
      inflammation and fibrosis, which closely mimics the pathological features of 
      human IPF. Numerous recent investigations have explored the functions of various 
      categories of stem cells in the healing process of lung injury induced by 
      bleomycin in mice, documenting the beneficial effects and challenges of this 
      approach. Differentiation of stem cells into various cell types and their ability 
      to modulate tissue microenvironment is an emerging aspect of the regenerative 
      therapies. This review article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the 
      role of stem cells in repairing bleomycin-induced lung injury. It delves into the 
      mechanisms through which various types of stem cells, including mesenchymal stem 
      cells, embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, and lung resident 
      stem cells, exert their therapeutic effects in this specific model. We have also 
      discussed the unique set of intermediate markers and signaling factors that can 
      influence the proliferation and differentiation of alveolar epithelial cells both 
      during lung repair and homeostasis. Finally, we highlight the challenges and 
      opportunities associated with translating stem cell therapy to the clinic for IPF 
      patients. The novelty and implications of this review extend beyond the 
      understanding of the potential of stem cells in treating IPF to the broader field 
      of regenerative medicine. We believe that the review paves the way for further 
      advancements in stem cell therapies, offering hope for patients suffering from 
      this debilitating and currently incurable disease.

AB  - As epigenetic modifications, lactylation and N6-methyladenosine (m6A) have 
      attracted wide attention. Arsenite is an environmental pollutant that has been 
      proven to induce idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, the molecular 
      mechanisms of lactylation and m6A methylation are unclear in arsenite-related IPF 
      (As-IPF). In view of the limited understanding of molecular mechanism of m6A and 
      lactylation in As-IPF, MeRIP-seq, RNA-seq and ChIP-seq were analyzed to verify 
      the target gene regulated by m6A and H3K18 lactylation (H3K18la). We found that, 
      for As-IPF, the global levels of m6A, levels of YTHDF1 and m6A-modified neuronal 
      protein 3.1 (NREP) were elevated in alveolar epithelial cells (AECs). The 
      secretion levels of TGF-beta1 were increased via YTHDF1/m6A/NREP, which promoted the 
      fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition (FMT). Further, extracellular lactate from 
      myofibroblasts elevated levels of the global lactylation (Kla) and H3K18la via 
      the lactate monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1), and, in AECs, H3K18la 
      facilitated the transcription of Ythdf1. This report highlights the role of 
      crosstalk between AECs and myofibroblasts via lactylation and m6A and the 
      significance of H3K18la regulation of YTHDF1 in the progression of As-IPF, which 
      may be useful for finding effective therapeutic targets.

AB  - Externalized histones erupt from the nucleus as extracellular traps, are 
      associated with several acute and chronic lung disorders, but their implications 
      in the molecular pathogenesis of interstitial lung disease are incompletely 
      defined. To investigate the role and molecular mechanisms of externalized 
      histones within the immunologic networks of pulmonary fibrosis, we studied 
      externalized histones in human and animal bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples of 
      lung fibrosis. Neutralizing anti-histone antibodies were administered in 
      bleomycin-induced fibrosis of C57BL/6 J mice, and subsequent studies used 
      conditional/constitutive knockout mouse strains for TGFbeta and IL-27 signaling 
      along with isolated platelets and cultured macrophages. We found that 
      externalized histones (citH3) were significantly (P < 0.01) increased in 
      cell-free BAL fluids of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF; n = 29) 
      as compared to healthy controls (n = 10). The pulmonary sources of externalized 
      histones were Ly6G(+)CD11b(+) neutrophils and nonhematopoietic cells after 
      bleomycin in mice. Neutralizing monoclonal anti-histone H2A/H4 antibodies reduced 
      the pulmonary collagen accumulation and hydroxyproline concentration. Histones 
      activated platelets to release TGFbeta1, which signaled through the TGFbRI/TGFbRII 
      receptor complex on LysM(+) cells to antagonize macrophage-derived IL-27 
      production. TGFbeta1 evoked multiple downstream mechanisms in macrophages, including 
      p38 MAPK, tristetraprolin, IL-10, and binding of SMAD3 to the IL-27 promotor 
      regions. IL-27RA-deficient mice displayed more severe collagen depositions 
      suggesting that intact IL-27 signaling limits fibrosis. In conclusion, 
      externalized histones inactivate a safety switch of antifibrotic, 
      macrophage-derived IL-27 by boosting platelet-derived TGFbeta1. Externalized 
      histones are accessible to neutralizing antibodies for improving the severity of 
      experimental pulmonary fibrosis.

TI  - Overexpression of KLF4 Suppresses Pulmonary Fibrosis through the 
      HIF-1alpha/Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Signaling Pathway.
LID - 10.3390/ijms241814008 [doi]
LID - 14008
AB  - The hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha/endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling pathway 
      (HIF-1alpha/ERS) has a crucial role in the pathogenetic mechanism of pulmonary 
      fibrosis (PF). However, the upstream regulatory mediators of this pathway remain 
      unclear. In the present study, by conducting bioinformatics analysis, we found 
      that Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) expression was decreased in the lung tissues of 
      patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) as compared to that in patients 
      with non-IPF. Furthermore, KLF4 expression was significantly reduced (p = 0.0331) 
      in bleomycin-induced fibrotic HFL-1 cells. Moreover, in mice with 
      bleomycin-induced PF, the degree of fibrosis was significantly reduced in mice 
      overexpressing KLF4 as compared to that in wild-type mice. In mice and HFL-1 
      cells, KLF4 overexpression significantly reduced bleomycin-induced protein 
      expression of HIF-1alpha (p = 0.0027) and ERS markers, particularly p-IRE1alpha (p = 
      0.0255) and ATF6 (p = 0.0002). By using the JASPAR database, we predicted that 
      KLF4 has five binding sites for the HIF-1alpha promoter. The results of in vitro and 
      in vivo studies suggest that KLF4 may inhibit PF through the HIF-1alpha/ERS pathway. 
      This finding could guide the development of future therapies for PF and 
      facilitate the identification of appropriate biomarkers for routine clinical 
      diagnosis of PF.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal lung disease 
      characterized by extensive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition by activated 
      myofibroblasts, which are specialized hyper-contractile cells that promote ECM 
      remodeling and matrix stiffening. New insights on therapeutic strategies aimed at 
      reversing fibrosis by targeting myofibroblast fate are showing promise in 
      promoting fibrosis resolution. Previously, we showed that a novel adipocytokine, 
      omentin-1, attenuated bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung fibrosis by reducing the 
      number of myofibroblasts. Apoptosis, deactivation, and reprogramming of 
      myofibroblasts are important processes in the resolution of fibrosis. Here we 
      report that omentin-1 reverses established lung fibrosis by promoting 
      mechanically activated myofibroblasts dedifferentiation into lipofibroblasts. 
      Omentin-1 promotes myofibroblasts lipogenic differentiation by inhibiting 
      dimerization and nuclear translocation of glycolytic enzymes pyruvate kinase 
      isoform M2 (PKM2) and activation of the downstream Yes-associated protein (YAP) 
      by increasing the cofactor fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (F1, 6BP, FBP). Moreover, 
      omentin-1 activates proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) signaling, the 
      master regulator of lipogenesis, and promotes the upregulation of the lipogenic 
      differentiation-related protein perilipin 2 (PLIN2) by suppressing the PKM2-YAP 
      pathway. Ultimately, omentin-1 facilitates myofibroblasts transformation into the 
      lipofibroblast phenotype, with reduced collagen synthesis and enhanced 
      degradation properties, which are crucial mechanisms to clear the ECM deposition 
      in fibrotic tissue, leading to fibrosis resolution. Our results indicate that 
      omentin-1 targets mechanical signal accelerates fibrosis resolution and reverses 
      established lung fibrosis by promoting myofibroblasts lipogenic differentiation, 
      which is closely associated with ECM clearance in fibrotic tissue. These findings 
      suggest that targeting mechanical force to promote myofibroblast lipogenic 
      differentiation is a promising therapeutic strategy against persistent lung 
      fibrosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has an unknown aetiology and 
      limited treatment options. A recent meta-analysis identified three novel causal 
      variants in the TERT, SPDL1, and KIF15 genes. This observational study aimed to 
      investigate whether the aforementioned variants cause clinical phenotypes in a 
      well-characterised IPF cohort. METHODS: The study consisted of 138 patients with 
      IPF who were diagnosed and treated at the Helsinki University Hospital and 
      genotyped in the FinnGen FinnIPF study. Data on > 25 clinical parameters were 
      collected by two pulmonologists who were blinded to the genetic data for patients 
      with TERT loss of function and missense variants, SPDL1 and KIF15 missense 
      variants, and a MUC5B variant commonly present in patients with IPF, or no 
      variants were separately analysed. RESULTS: The KIF15 missense variant is 
      associated with the early onset of the disease, leading to progression to 
      early-age transplantation or death. In patients with the KIF15 variant, the 
      median age at diagnosis was 54.0 years (36.5-69.5 years) compared with 72.0 years 
      (65.8-75.3 years) in the other patients (P = 0.023). The proportion of KIF15 
      variant carriers was 9- or 3.6-fold higher in patients aged < 55 or 65 years, 
      respectively. The variants for TERT and MUC5B had similar effects on the 
      patient's clinical course, as previously described. No distinct phenotypes were 
      observed in patients with the SPDL1 variant. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated the 
      potential of KIF15 to be used in the genetic diagnostics of IPF. Further studies 
      are needed to elucidate the biological mechanisms of KIF15 in IPF.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most common and serious type of 
      idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, characterized by chronic, progressive, and low 
      survival rates, while unknown disease etiology. Until recently, patients with 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have a poor prognosis, high mortality, and limited 
      treatment options, due to the lack of effective early diagnostic and prognostic 
      tools. Therefore, we aimed to identify biomarkers for idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis based on multiple machine-learning approaches and to evaluate the role 
      of immune infiltration in the disease. The gene expression profile and its 
      corresponding clinical data of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients were 
      downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Next, the differentially 
      expressed genes (DEGs) with the threshold of FDR < 0.05 and |log2 foldchange 
      (FC)| > 0.585 were analyzed via R package "DESeq2" and GO enrichment and KEGG 
      pathways were run in R software. Then, least absolute shrinkage and selection 
      operator (LASSO) logistic regression, support vector machine-recursive feature 
      elimination (SVM-RFE) and random forest (RF) algorithms were combined to screen 
      the key potential biomarkers of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The diagnostic 
      performance of these biomarkers was evaluated through receiver operating 
      characteristic (ROC) curves. Moreover, the CIBERSORT algorithm was employed to 
      assess the infiltration of immune cells and the relationship between the 
      infiltrating immune cells and the biomarkers. Finally, we sought to understand 
      the potential pathogenic role of the biomarker (SLAIN1) in idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis using a mouse model and cellular model. A total of 3658 differentially 
      expressed genes of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis were identified, including 2359 
      upregulated genes and 1299 downregulated genes. FHL2, HPCAL1, RNF182, and SLAIN1 
      were identified as biomarkers of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis using LASSO 
      logistic regression, RF, and SVM-RFE algorithms. The ROC curves confirmed the 
      predictive accuracy of these biomarkers both in the training set and test set. 
      Immune cell infiltration analysis suggested that patients with idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis had a higher level of B cells memory, Plasma cells, T cells 
      CD8, T cells follicular helper, T cells regulatory (Tregs), Macrophages M0, and 
      Mast cells resting compared with the control group. Correlation analysis 
      demonstrated that FHL2 was significantly associated with the infiltrating immune 
      cells. qPCR and western blotting analysis suggested that SLAIN1 might be a 
      signature for the diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. In this study, we 
      identified four potential biomarkers (FHL2, HPCAL1, RNF182, and SLAIN1) and 
      evaluated the potential pathogenic role of SLAIN1 in idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis. These findings may have great significance in guiding the understanding 
      of disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets in idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remains 
      unclear. We sought to identify IPF-related genes that may participate in the 
      pathogenesis and predict potential targeted traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs). 
      METHODS: Using IPF gene-expression data, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were performed 
      to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Protein-protein interaction 
      (PPI) networks, hub genes, and competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks were 
      constructed or identified by Cytoscape. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction 
      (qPCR) experiments in TGF-beta1-induced human fetal lung (HFL) fibroblast cells and 
      a pulmonary fibrosis mouse model verified gene reliability. The SymMap database 
      predicted potential TCMs targeting IPF. The reliability of TCMs was verified in 
      TGF-beta1-induced MRC-5 cells. MATERIALS: Multiple gene-expression profile data of 
      normal lung and IPF tissues were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus 
      database. HFL fibroblast cells and MRC-5 cells were purchased from Wuhan Procell 
      Life Science and Technology Co., Ltd. (Wuhan, China). C57BL/12 mice were 
      purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. 
      (Beijing, China). RESULTS: In datasets GSE134692 and GSE15197, DEGs were 
      identified using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests (both p < 0.05). Among them, 1885 DEGs 
      were commonly identified, and 87% (1640 genes) had identical dysregulation 
      directions (binomial test, p < 1.00E-16). A PPI network with 1623 nodes and 8159 
      edges was constructed, and 18 hub genes were identified using the Analyze Network 
      plugin in Cytoscape. Of 18 genes, CAV1, PECAM1, BMP4, VEGFA, FYN, SPP1, and 
      COL1A1 were further validated in the GeneCards database and independent dataset 
      GSE24206. ceRNA networks of VEGFA, SPP1, and COL1A1 were constructed. The genes 
      were verified by qPCR in samples of TGF-beta1-induced HFL fibroblast cells and 
      pulmonary fibrosis mice. Finally, Sea Buckthorn and Gnaphalium Affine were 
      predicted as potential TCMs for IPF. The TCMs were verified by qPCR in 
      TGF-beta1-induced MRC-5 cells. CONCLUSION: This analysis strategy may be useful for 
      elucidating novel mechanisms underlying IPF at the transcriptome level. The 
      identified hub genes may play key roles in IPF pathogenesis and therapy.

TI  - Genistein alleviates pulmonary fibrosis by inactivating lung fibroblasts.
PG  - 143-148
AB  - Pulmonary fibrosis is a serious lung disease that occurs predominantly in men. 
      Genistein is an important natural soybeanderived phytoestrogen that affects 
      various biological functions, such as cell migration and fibrosis. However, the 
      antifibrotic effects of genistein on pulmonary fibrosis are largely unknown. The 
      antifibrotic effects of genistein were evaluated using in vitro and in vivo 
      models of lung fibrosis. Proteomic data were analyzed using nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS. 
      Genistein significantly reduced transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1-induced 
      expression of collagen type I and alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA) in MRC-5 cells and 
      primary fibroblasts from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). 
      Genistein also reduced TGF-beta1-induced expression of p-Smad2/3 and p-p38 MAPK in 
      fibroblast models. Comprehensive protein analysis confirmed that genistein 
      exerted an anti-fibrotic effect by regulating various molecular mechanisms, such 
      as unfolded protein response, epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), mammalian 
      target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling, cell death, and several 
      metabolic pathways. Genistein was also found to decrease hydroxyproline levels in 
      the lungs of BLM-treated mice. Genistein exerted an anti-fibrotic effect by 
      preventing fibroblast activation, suggesting that genistein could be developed as 
      a pharmacological agent for the prevention and treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a progressively debilitating lung 
      condition characterized by oxidative stress, cell phenotype shifts, and excessive 
      extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. Recent studies have shown promising 
      results using decellularized ECM-derived hydrogels produced through pepsin 
      digestion in various lung injury models and even a human clinical trial for 
      myocardial infarction. This study aimed to characterize the composition of 
      ECM-derived hydrogels, assess their potential to prevent fibrosis in 
      bleomycin-induced IPF models, and unravel their underlying molecular mechanisms 
      of action. Porcine lungs were decellularized and pepsin-digested for 48 h. The 
      hydrogel production process, including visualization of protein molecular weight 
      distribution and hydrogel gelation, was characterized. Peptidomics analysis of 
      ECM-derived hydrogel contained peptides from 224 proteins. Probable bioactive and 
      cell-penetrating peptides, including collagen IV, laminin beta 2, and actin alpha 
      1, were identified. ECM-derived hydrogel treatment was administered as an early 
      intervention to prevent fibrosis advancement in rat models of bleomycin-induced 
      pulmonary fibrosis. ECM-derived hydrogel concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 2 mg/mL 
      showed subtle but noticeable effects on reducing lung inflammation, oxidative 
      damage, and protein markers related to fibrosis (e.g., alpha-smooth muscle actin, 
      collagen I). Moreover, distinct changes were observed in macroscopic appearance, 
      alveolar structure, collagen deposition, and protein expression between lungs 
      that received ECM-derived hydrogel and control fibrotic lungs. Proteomic analyses 
      revealed significant protein and gene expression changes related to cellular 
      processes, pathways, and components involved in tissue remodeling, inflammation, 
      and cytoskeleton regulation. RNA sequencing highlighted differentially expressed 
      genes associated with various cellular processes, such as tissue remodeling, 
      hormone secretion, cell chemotaxis, and cytoskeleton engagement. This study 
      suggests that ECM-derived hydrogel treatment influence pathways associated with 
      tissue repair, inflammation regulation, cytoskeleton reorganization, and cellular 
      response to injury, potentially offering therapeutic benefits in preventing or 
      mitigating lung fibrosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive 
      interstitial lung disease. Multiple research has revealed that the extracellular 
      matrix (ECM) may be associated with the development and prognosis of IPF, 
      however, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. METHODS: We 
      included GSE70866 dataset from the GEO database and established an ECM-related 
      prognostic model utilizing LASSO, Random forest and Support vector machines 
      algorithms. To compare immune cell infiltration levels between the high and low 
      risk groups, we employed the ssGSEA algorithm. Enrichment analysis was conducted 
      to explore pathway differences between the high-risk and low-risk groups. 
      Finally, the model genes were validated using an external validation set 
      consisting of IPF cases, as well as single-cell data analysis. RESULTS: Based on 
      machine learning algorithms, we constructed an ECM-related risk model. IPF 
      patients in the high-risk group had a worse overall survival rate than those in 
      the low-risk group. The model's AUC predictive values were 0.786, 0.767, and 
      0.768 for the 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates, respectively. The validation 
      cohort validated these findings, demonstrating our model's effective 
      prognostication. Chemokine-related pathways were enriched through enrichment 
      analysis. Moreover, immune cell infiltration varied significantly between the two 
      groups. Finally, the validation results indicate that the expression levels of 
      all the model genes exhibited significant differential expression. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Based on CST6, PPBP, CSPG4, SEMA3B, LAMB2, SERPINB4 and CTF1, our study developed 
      and validated an ECM-related risk model that accurately predicts the outcome of 
      IPF patients.

TI  - Differential Transcriptomic Signatures of Small Airway Cell Cultures Derived from 
      IPF and COVID-19-Induced Exacerbation of Interstitial Lung Disease.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a pathological condition wherein lung 
      injury precipitates the deposition of scar tissue, ultimately leading to a 
      decline in pulmonary function. Existing research indicates a notable exacerbation 
      in the clinical prognosis of IPF patients following infection with COVID-19. This 
      investigation employed bulk RNA-sequencing methodologies to describe the 
      transcriptomic profiles of small airway cell cultures derived from IPF and 
      post-COVID fibrosis patients. Differential gene expression analysis unveiled 
      heightened activation of pathways associated with microtubule assembly and 
      interferon signaling in IPF cell cultures. Conversely, post-COVID fibrosis cell 
      cultures exhibited distinctive characteristics, including the upregulation of 
      pathways linked to extracellular matrix remodeling, immune system response, and 
      TGF-beta1 signaling. Notably, BMP signaling levels were elevated in cell cultures 
      derived from IPF patients compared to non-IPF control and post-COVID fibrosis 
      samples. These findings underscore the molecular distinctions between IPF and 
      post-COVID fibrosis, particularly in the context of signaling pathways associated 
      with each condition. A better understanding of the underlying molecular 
      mechanisms holds the promise of identifying potential therapeutic targets for 
      future interventions in these diseases.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) represents a chronic progressive fibrotic 
      interstitial lung disease of unknown cause with an ominous prognosis. It remains 
      an unprecedent clinical challenge due to its delayed diagnosis and unpredictable 
      clinical course. The need for accurate diagnostic, prognostic and predisposition 
      biomarkers in everyday clinical practice becomes more necessary than ever to 
      ensure prompt diagnoses and early treatment. The identification of such blood 
      biomarkers may also unravel novel drug targets against IPF development and 
      progression. So far, the role of diverse blood biomarkers, implicated in various 
      pathogenetic pathways, such as in fibrogenesis (S100A4), extracellular matrix 
      remodelling (YKL-40, MMP-7, ICAM-1, LOXL2, periostin), chemotaxis (CCL-18, IL-8), 
      epithelial cell injury (KL-6, SP-A, SP-D), autophagy and unfolded protein 
      response has been investigated in IPF with various results. Moreover, the recent 
      progress in genetics in IPF allows for a better understanding of the underlying 
      disease mechanisms. So far, the causative mutations in pulmonary fibrosis include 
      mutations in telomere-related genes and in surfactant-related genes, markers that 
      could act as predisposition biomarkers in IPF. The aim of this review is to 
      provide a comprehensive overview from the bench to bedside of current knowledge 
      and recent insights on biomarkers in IPF, and to suggest future directions for 
      research. Large-scale studies are still needed to confirm the exact role of these 
      biomarkers.

AB  - With increasing research on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and 
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), more and more studies have indicated that 
      GERD is associated with IPF, but the underlying pathological mechanisms remain 
      unclear. The aim of the present study is to identify and analyse the 
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between IPF and GERD and explore the 
      relevant molecular mechanisms via bioinformatics analysis. Four GEO datasets 
      (GSE24206, GSE53845, GSE26886, and GSE39491) were downloaded from the GEO 
      database, and DEGs between IPF and GERD were identified with the online tool 
      GEO2R. Subsequently, a series of bioinformatics analyses are conducted, including 
      Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and gene ontology (GO) enrichment 
      analyses, the PPI network, biological characteristics, TF-gene interactions, 
      TF-miRNA coregulatory networks, and the prediction of drug molecules. Totally, 71 
      genes were identified as DEGs in IPF and GERD. Five KEGG pathways, including 
      Amoebiasis, Protein digestion and absorption, Relaxin signalling pathway, 
      AGE-RAGE signalling pathway in diabetic complications, and Drug metabolism - 
      cytochrome P450, were significantly enriched. In addition, eight hub genes, 
      including POSTN, MMP1, COL3A1, COL1A2, CXCL12, TIMP3, VCAM1, and COL1A1 were 
      selected from the PPI network by Cytoscape software. Then, five hub genes (MMP1, 
      POSTN, COL3A1, COL1A2, and COL1A1) with high diagnostic values for IPF and GERD 
      were validated by GEO datasets. Finally, TF-gene and miRNA interaction was 
      identified with hub genes and predicted drug molecules for the IPF and GERD. And 
      the results suggest that cetirizine, luteolin, and pempidine may have great 
      potential therapeutic value in IPF and GERD. This study will provide novel 
      strategies for the identification of potential biomarkers and valuable 
      therapeutic targets for IPF and GERD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive chronic 
      inflammatory disease with poor clinical outcomes and ineffective drug treatment 
      options. Eupatilin is a major component extracted from the traditional herbal 
      medicine Artemisia asiatica Nakai. Notably, it was demonstrated to have an 
      anti-fibrosis effect in endometrial fibrosis, vocal fold, and hepatic fibrosis. 
      Its role and mechanism in IPF remain unclear. METHODS: This study used the 
      TGF-beta1-induced human embryonic lung fibroblasts (MRC-5) activation, IPF lung 
      fibroblasts, and bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis mice model. Western blot, 
      immunofluorescence staining, quantitative real time-PCR, hematoxylin and eosin 
      staining, Masson's trichrome staining, and immunohistochemistry were used to 
      evaluate the effects of eupatilin on fibroblast activation, pulmonary fibrosis, 
      and autophagy. The autophagosomes were observed with a transmission electron 
      microscope (TEM). RNA sequencing was used to determine the signaling pathway and 
      key regulator related to autophagy. RESULTS: Eupatilin significantly decreased 
      the expression of Col1A1, fibronectin, alpha-SMA, and SQSTM1/p62. In contrast, it 
      increased the expression of LC3B II/I and the number of autophagosomes in TGF-beta1 
      treated MRC-5, IPF lung fibroblasts, and bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis mice 
      model; it also alleviated bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. The KEGG pathway 
      mapping displayed that PI3K/Akt and Sestrin2 were associated with the enhanced 
      fibrogenic process. Eupatilin suppressed the phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR. 
      Autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and Akt activator SC-79 abrogated the 
      anti-fibrotic effect of eupatilin. Sestrin2 expression was also downregulated in 
      TGF-beta1 treated lung fibroblasts and lung tissues of the bleomycin-induced 
      pulmonary fibrosis mice model. Furthermore, eupatilin promoted Sestrin2 
      expression, and the knockdown of Sestrin2 significantly aggravated the degree of 
      fibrosis, increased the phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR, and decreased 
      autophagy. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that eupatilin ameliorates 
      pulmonary fibrosis through Sestrin2/PI3K/Akt/mTOR-dependent autophagy pathway.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dermatomyositis (DM) is an autoimmune and inflammatory disease that 
      can affect the lungs, causing interstitial lung diseases (ILD). However, the 
      exact pathophysiological mechanisms underlying DM-ILD are unknown. Idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) belongs to the broader spectrum of ILD and evidence 
      shows that common pathologic pathways might lie between IPF and DM-ILD. METHODS: 
      We retrieved gene expression profiles of DM and IPF from the Gene Expression 
      Omnibus (GEO) and utilized weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) 
      to reveal their co-expression modules. We then performed a differentially 
      expressed gene (DEG) analysis to identify common DEGs. Enrichment analyses were 
      employed to uncover the hidden biological pathways. Additionally, we conducted 
      protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks analysis, cluster analysis, and 
      successfully found the hub genes, whose levels were further validated in DM-ILD 
      patients. We also examined the relationship between hub genes and immune cell 
      abundance in DM and IPF. Finally, we conducted a common transcription factors 
      (TFs)-genes network by NetworkAnalyst. RESULTS: WGCNA revealed 258 intersecting 
      genes, while DEG analysis identified 66 shared genes in DM and IPF. All of these 
      genes were closely related to extracellular matrix and structure, cell-substrate 
      adhesion, and collagen metabolism. Four hub genes (POSTN, THBS2, COL6A1, and 
      LOXL1) were derived through intersecting the top 30 genes of the WGCNA and DEG 
      sets. They were validated as active transcripts and showed diagnostic values for 
      DM and IPF. However, ssGSEA revealed distinct infiltration patterns in DM and 
      IPF. These four genes all showed a positive correlation with immune cells 
      abundance in DM, but not in IPF. Finally, we identified one possible key 
      transcription factor, MYC, that interact with all four hub genes. CONCLUSION: 
      Through bioinformatics analysis, we identified common hub genes and shared 
      molecular pathways underlying DM and IPF, which provides valuable insights into 
      the intricate mechanisms of these diseases and offers potential targets for 
      diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.

AB  - The pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
      (IPF) and other forms of interstitial lung disease, involves a complex interplay 
      of various factors including host genetics, environmental pollutants, infection, 
      aberrant repair and dysregulated immune responses. Highly variable clinical 
      outcomes of some ILDs, in particular IPF, have made it difficult to identify the 
      precise mechanisms involved in disease pathogenesis and thus the development of a 
      specific cure or treatment to halt and reverse the decline in patient health. 
      With the advent of in-depth molecular diagnostics, it is becoming evident that 
      the pathogenesis of IPF is unlikely to be the same for all patients and therefore 
      will likely require different treatment approaches. Chronic inflammation is a 
      cardinal feature of IPF and is driven by both innate and adaptive immune 
      responses. Inflammatory cells and activated fibroblasts secrete various 
      pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that perpetuate the inflammatory 
      response and contribute to the recruitment and activation of more immune cells 
      and fibroblasts. The balance between pro-inflammatory and regulatory immune cell 
      subsets, as well as the interactions between immune cell types and resident cells 
      within the lung microenvironment, ultimately determines the extent of fibrosis 
      and the potential for resolution. This review examines the role of the innate and 
      adaptive immune responses in pulmonary fibrosis, with an emphasis on IPF. The 
      role of different immune cell types is discussed as well as novel 
      anti-inflammatory and immunotherapy approaches currently in clinical trial or in 
      preclinical development.

PG  - 620-635

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), as the most common idiopathic interstitial 
      pneumonia, is caused by a complex interaction of pathological mechanisms. 
      Interestingly, IPF frequently occurs in the middle-aged and elderly populations 
      but rarely affects young people. Salvianolic acid B (SAB) exerts antioxidant, 
      antiinflammatory, and antifibrotic bioactivities and is considered a promising 
      drug for pulmonary disease treatment. However, the pharmacological effects and 
      mechanisms of SAB on cellular senescence of lung cells and IPF development remain 
      unclear. We used bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis mice and different 
      lung cells to investigate the antisenescence impact of SAB and explain its 
      underlying mechanism by network pharmacology and the Human Protein Atlas 
      database. Here, we found that SAB significantly prevented pulmonary fibrosis and 
      cellular senescence in mice, and reversed the senescence trend and typical 
      senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors released from lung 
      macrophages and alveolar type II (AT2) epithelial cells, which further reduced 
      lung fibroblasts activation. Additionally, SAB alleviated the 
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition process of AT2 cells induced by transforming 
      growth factor beta. By predicting potential targets of SAB that were then 
      confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR technology, we determined that 
      SAB directly hampered the binding of transcription factor stimulating protein 1 
      to the promoters of SASPs (P21 and P16), thus halting lung cell senescence. We 
      demonstrated that SAB reduced BLM-induced AT2 and macrophage senescence, and the 
      subsequent release of SASP factors that activated lung fibroblasts, thereby 
      dual-relieving IPF. This study provides a new scientific foundation and 
      perspective for pulmonary fibrosis therapy.

TI  - LEF1 isoforms regulate cellular senescence and aging.

AB  - The study of aging and its mechanisms, such as cellular senescence, has provided 
      valuable insights into age-related pathologies, thus contributing to their 
      prevention and treatment. The current abundance of high-throughput data combined 
      with the surge of robust analysis algorithms has facilitated novel ways of 
      identifying underlying pathways that may drive these pathologies. For the purpose 
      of identifying key regulators of lung aging, we performed comparative analyses of 
      transcriptional profiles of aged versus young human subjects and mice, focusing 
      on the common age-related changes in the transcriptional regulation in lung 
      macrophages, T cells, and B immune cells. Importantly, we validated our findings 
      in cell culture assays and human lung samples. Our analysis identified lymphoid 
      enhancer binding factor 1 (LEF1) as an important age-associated regulator of gene 
      expression in all three cell types across different tissues and species. 
      Follow-up experiments showed that the differential expression of long and short 
      LEF1 isoforms is a key regulatory mechanism of cellular senescence. Further 
      examination of lung tissue from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, an 
      age-related disease with strong ties to cellular senescence, revealed a stark 
      dysregulation of LEF1. Collectively, our results suggest that LEF1 is a key

AB  - The global COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 virus has resulted in a significant number of patients experiencing 
      persistent symptoms, including post-COVID pulmonary fibrosis (PCPF). This study 
      aimed to identify novel therapeutic targets for PCPF using single-cell 
      RNA-sequencing data from lung tissues of COVID-19 patients, idiopathic pulmonary 
      fibrosis (IPF) patients, and a rat transforming growth factor beta-1-induced 
      fibrosis model treated with antifibrotic drugs. Patients with COVID-19 had lower 
      alveolar macrophage counts than healthy controls, whereas patients with COVID-19 
      and IPF presented with elevated monocyte-derived macrophage counts. A comparative 
      transcriptome analysis showed that macrophages play a crucial role in IPF and 
      COVID-19 development and progression, and fibrosis- and inflammation-associated 
      genes were upregulated in both conditions. Functional enrichment analysis 
      revealed the upregulation of inflammation and proteolysis and the downregulation 
      of ribosome biogenesis. Cholesterol efflux and glycolysis were augmented in both 
      macrophage types. The study suggests that antifibrotic drugs may reverse critical 
      lung fibrosis mediators in COVID-19. The results help clarify the molecular 
      mechanisms underlying pulmonary fibrosis in patients with severe COVID-19 and IPF 
      and highlight the potential efficacy of antifibrotic drugs in COVID-19 therapy. 
      Collectively, all these findings may have significant implications for the 
      development of new treatment strategies for PCPF.

AB  - Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), or diffuse pulmonary lung disease, are a 
      subset of lung diseases that primarily affect lung alveoli and the space around 
      interstitial tissue and bronchioles. It clinically manifests as progressive 
      dyspnea, and patients often exhibit a varied decrease in pulmonary diffusion 
      function. Recently, variants in telomere biology-related genes have been 
      identified as genetic lesions of ILDs. Here, we enrolled 82 patients with 
      interstitial pneumonia from 2017 to 2021 in our hospital to explore the candidate 
      gene mutations of these patients via whole-exome sequencing. After data 
      filtering, a novel heterozygous mutation (NM_025099: p.Gly131Arg) of CTC1 was 
      identified in two affected family members. As a component of CST (CTC1-STN1-TEN1) 
      complex, CTC1 is responsible for maintaining telomeric structure integrity and 
      has also been identified as a candidate gene for IPF, a special kind of chronic 
      ILD with insidious onset. Simultaneously, real-time PCR revealed that two 
      affected family members presented with short telomere lengths, which further 
      confirmed the effect of the mutation in the CTC1 gene. Our study not only 
      expanded the mutation spectrum of CTC1 and provided epidemiological data on ILDs 
      caused by CTC1 mutations but also further confirmed the relationship between 
      heterozygous mutations in CTC1 and ILDs, which may further contribute to 
      understanding the mechanisms underlying ILDs.

PG  - 346
LID - 10.1007/s10142-023-01274-y [doi]
AB  - Patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) have a significantly higher 
      prevalence of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) than normal subjects, although the 
      underlying association is unclear. The raw data involved were obtained from the 
      Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differential expression analysis and 
      weighted gene co-expression network analysis were used to screen for 
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and modular signature genes (MSGs). Genes 
      intersecting DEGs and MSGs were considered hub genes for IPF and LUAD. Machine 
      learning algorithms were applied to capture epithelial cell-derived signature 
      genes (EDSGs) shared. External cohort data were exploited to validate the 
      robustness of EDSGs. Immunohistochemical staining and K-M plots were used to 
      denote the prognostic value of EDSGs in LUAD. Based on EDSGs, we constructed a 
      TF-gene-miRNA regulatory network. Molecular docking can validate the strength of 
      action between candidate drugs and EDSGs. Epithelial cells, 650 DEGs, and 1773 
      MSGs were shared by IPF and LUAD. As for 379 hub genes, we performed pathway and 
      functional enrichment analysis. By analyzing sc-RNA seq data, we identified 1234 
      marker genes of IPF epithelial cell-derived and 1481 of LUAD. And these genes 
      shared 8 items with 379 hub genes. Through the machine learning algorithms, we 
      further fished TRIM2, S100A14, CYP4B1, LMO7, and SFN. The ROC curves emphasized 
      the significance of EDSGs in predicting the onset of LUAD and IPF. The 
      TF-gene-miRNA network revealed regulatory relationships behind EDSGs. Finally, we 
      predicted appropriate therapeutic agents. Our study preliminarily identified 
      potential mechanisms between IPF and LUAD, which will inform subsequent studies.

TI  - Evaluation of common protein biomarkers involved in the pathogenesis of 
      respiratory diseases with proteomic methods: A systematic review.
PG  - e1090
LID - 10.1002/iid3.1090 [doi]
LID - e1090
AB  - AIM: Respiratory disease (RD) is one of the most common diseases characterized by 
      lung dysfunction. Many diagnostic mechanisms have been used to identify the 
      pathogenic agents of responsible for RD. Among these, proteomics emerges as a 
      valuable diagnostic method for pinpointing the specific proteins involved in RD 
      pathogenesis. Therefore, in this study, for the first time, we examined the 
      protein markers involved in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary 
      disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), asthma, bronchiolitis 
      obliterans (BO), and chemical warfare victims exposed to mustard gas, using the 
      proteomics method as a systematic study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic 
      search was performed up to September 2023 on several databases, including PubMed, 
      Scopus, ISI Web of Science, and Cochrane. In total, selected 4246 articles were 
      for evaluation according to the criteria. Finally, 119 studies were selected for 
      this systematic review. RESULTS: A total of 13,806 proteins were identified, 6471 
      in COPD, 1603 in Asthma, 5638 in IPF, three in BO, and 91 in mustard gas exposed 
      victims. Alterations in the expression of these proteins were observed in the 
      respective diseases. After evaluation, the results showed that 31 proteins were 
      found to be shared among all five diseases. CONCLUSION: Although these 31 
      proteins regulate different factors and molecular pathways in all five diseases, 
      they ultimately lead to the regulation of inflammatory pathways. In other words, 
      the expression of some proteins in COPD and mustard-exposed patients increases

TI  - GOLM1 Promotes Pulmonary Fibrosis through Upregulation of NEAT1.
PG  - 178-192
LID - 10.1165/rcmb.2023-0151OC [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal progressive disease with elusive 
      molecular mechanisms and limited therapeutic options. Aberrant activation of 
      fibroblasts is a central hallmark of lung fibrosis. Here, we report that Golgi 
      membrane protein 1 (GOLM1, also known as GP73 or GOLPH2) was increased in the 
      lungs of patients with pulmonary fibrosis and mice with bleomycin (BLM)-induced 
      pulmonary fibrosis. Loss of GOLM1 inhibited proliferation, differentiation, and 
      extracellular matrix deposition of fibroblasts, whereas overexpression of GOLM1 
      exerted the opposite effects. Similarly, worsening pulmonary fibrosis after BLM 
      treatment was observed in GOLM1-knock-in mice, whereas BLM-treated Golm1-knockout 
      mice exhibited alleviated pulmonary fibrosis and collagen deposition. 
      Furthermore, we identified long noncoding RNA NEAT1 downstream of GOLM1 as a 
      potential mediator of pulmonary fibrosis through increased GOLM1 expression. 
      Depletion of NEAT1 inhibited fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix 
      production and reversed the profibrotic effects of GOLM1 overexpression. 
      Additionally, we identified KLF4 as a downstream mediator of GOLM1 signaling to 
      NEAT1. Our findings suggest that GOLM1 plays a pivotal role in promoting 
      pulmonary fibrosis through the GOLM1-KLF4-NEAT1 signaling axis. Targeting GOLM1 
      and its downstream pathways may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for 
      treating pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cuproptosis, the most recently identified and regulated cell death, 
      depends on copper ions in vivo. Copper regulates the pathogenesis of Idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), but the mechanism of action underlying cuproptosis in 
      IPF remains unclear. METHODS: We identified three cuproptosis patterns based on 
      ten cuproptosis-related genes using unsupervised consensus clustering. We 
      quantified these patterns using a PCA algorithm to construct a cuproptosis score. 
      ssGSEA and the Cibersort algorithm assessed the immune profile of IPF patients. 
      GSEA and GSVA were used to analyze the functional differences in different 
      molecular patterns. Drug susceptibility prediction based on cuproptosis scores 
      and meaningful gene markers was eventually screened in combination with external 
      public data sets,in vitro experiments and our cases. RESULTS: Of the three types 
      of cuproptosis-related clusters identified in the study, patients in the 
      clusterA, geneclusterB, and score-high groups showed improved prognoses. 
      Moreover, each cluster exhibited differential immune characteristics, with the 
      subtype showing a poorer prognosis associated with an immune overreaction. 
      Cuproptosis score can be an independent risk factor for predicting the prognosis 
      of IPF patients. GSEA showed a significant functional correlation between the 
      score and cuproptosis. The genes AKAP9, ANK3, C6orf106, LYRM7, and MBNL1, were 
      identified as prognostic-related signatures in IPF patients. The functional role 
      of immune regulation in IPF was further explored by correlating essential genes 
      with immune factors. Also, the nomogram constructed by cumulative information 
      from gene markers and cuproptosis score showed reliable clinical application. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Cuproptosis patterns differ significantly in the prognosis and 
      immune characteristics of IPF patients. The cuproptosis score and five gene 
      signatures can provide a reliable reference in the prognosis and diagnosis of 
      IPF.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a serious, lifelong lung disease with high 
      morbidity and high mortality. Menstrual blood-derived stem cells (MenSCs) derived 
      exosomes (MenSCs-Exo) emerge as an attractive tool for the treatment of acute 
      lung injury and fibrosis-related diseases. However, more comprehensive mechanism 
      over how MenSCs derived exosomes exhibits anti-pulmonary fibrosis needs to be 
      elucidated. In this study, TGF-beta was used to construct cell fibrosis model, and 
      bleomycin (BLM) was applied to induce lung tissue fibrosis mice model. BLM- and 
      TGF-beta1-induced cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 
      damage, and lung epithelial cell apoptosis were alleviated by MenSCs-Exo 
      treatment in vivo and in vitro. Besides, it was found that MenSCs-Exo delivered 
      miR-let-7 into MLE-12 cells/lung epithelial cell and the reduction of miR-let-7 
      blocked the improvement produced by MenSCs-Exo. Mechanistically, miR-let-7 
      directly bound to Sp3 and negatively regulated its expression. Sp3 elevation 
      promoted the expression of ferroptosis-related protein and mitochondrial DNA 
      (mtDNA) damage markers via recruiting HDAC2, thereby inactivating keap1/Nrf2 
      signal cascade, which were confirmed in BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis mice model 
      under the combination therapy of the MenSCs-Exo and let-7 inhibitor. 
      Collectively, MenSCs derived exosomes could transmit miR-let-7 into MLE-12 cells 
      to inhibit the expression of Sp3, thereby weakening the recruitment effect of Sp3 
      on HDAC2, lifting the deacetylation restriction of HDAC2 on Nrf2, and enhancing 
      the Nrf2 pathway. These changes further declined ferroptosis and delayed the 
      pathological process of oxidative damage and lung epithelial cell apoptosis in 
      PF.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive lung disease 
      involving multiple factors and genes. Astragaloside IV (ASV) is one of the main 
      bioactive ingredients extracted from the root of Astragalus membranaceus, which 
      plays an important role in anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and improve 
      cardiopulmonary function. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key driver 
      of the process of pulmonary fibrosis, and Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 
      (ZEB1) can promote pulmonary fibrosis in an EMT-dependent manner. Here, we found 
      that ASV effectively inhibited the ZEB1 and EMT in both bleomycin (BLM)-induced 
      rat pulmonary fibrosis and TGF-beta1-treated A549 cells. To further elucidate the 
      molecular mechanisms underlying effects of ASV in IPF, we explored the truth 
      using bioinformatics, plasmid construction, immunofluorescence staining, western 
      blotting and other experiments. Dual luciferase reporter assay and bioinformatics 
      proved that miR-200c not only acts as an upstream regulatory miRNA of ZEB1 but 
      also has binding sites for the lncRNA-ATB. In A549 cell-based EMT models, ASV 
      reduced the expression of lncRNA-ATB and upregulated miR-200c. Furthermore, 
      overexpression of lncRNA-ATB and silencing of miR-200c reversed the 
      down-regulation of ZEB1 and the inhibition of EMT processes by ASV. In addition, 
      the intervention of ASV prevented lncRNA-ATB as a ceRNA from regulating the 
      expression of ZEB1 through sponging miR-200c. Taken together, the results showed 
      that ASV inhibited the EMT process through the lncRNA-ATB/miR-200c/ZEB1 signaling 
      pathway, which provides a novel approach to the treatment of IPF.

AB  - Fibroblast to myofibroblast transdifferentiation mediates numerous fibrotic 
      disorders, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We have previously 
      demonstrated that non-muscle myosin II (NMII) is activated in response to 
      fibrotic lung extracellular matrix, thereby mediating myofibroblast 
      transdifferentiation. NMII-A is known to interact with the calcium-binding 
      protein S100A4, but the mechanism by which S100A4 regulates fibrotic disorders is 
      unclear. In this study, we show that fibroblast S100A4 is a calcium-dependent, 
      mechanoeffector protein that is uniquely sensitive to pathophysiologic-range lung 
      stiffness (8-25 kPa) and thereby mediates myofibroblast transdifferentiation. 
      Re-expression of endogenous fibroblast S100A4 rescues the myofibroblastic 
      phenotype in S100A4 KO fibroblasts. Analysis of NMII-A/actin dynamics reveals 
      that S100A4 mediates the unraveling and redistribution of peripheral actomyosin 
      to a central location, resulting in a contractile myofibroblast. Furthermore, 
      S100A4 loss protects against murine in vivo pulmonary fibrosis, and S100A4 
      expression is dysregulated in IPF. Our data reveal a novel mechanosensor/effector 
      role for endogenous fibroblast S100A4 in inducing cytoskeletal redistribution in 
      fibrotic disorders such as IPF.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a life-threatening disease that leads to 
      dyspnea and progressive loss of lung function. This study aimed to investigate 
      the protective effect of betanin (BET), the major pigment in red beetroot, on 
      pulmonary fibrosis induced by bleomycin (BLM) in rats and to assess the 
      underlying mechanisms. In this view, total and differential cell counts and LDH 
      activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were estimated. Furthermore, MDA and GSH 
      contents in the lungs were colorimetrically measured, while hydroxyproline, 
      NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, TGF-beta1, and vimentin levels in lung tissue were evaluated 
      using the ELISA technique. Moreover, IL-1beta, E-cadherin, and alpha-SMA expressions 
      were analyzed by immunostaining of lung specimens. BET treatment protects against 
      pulmonary fibrosis as indicated by the reduction in total and differential cell 
      counts, LDH activity, hydroxyproline, NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, IL-1beta, and TGF-beta1 
      levels. MDA content was also decreased following BET administration, while GSH 
      content was elevated. Additionally, BET suppressed the EMT process as evidenced 
      by an increase in E-cadherin expression besides the reduction in vimentin and 
      alpha-SMA expressions. To conclude, these results revealed the protective effect of 
      BET against pulmonary fibrosis that might be attributed to the attenuation of the 
      NLRP3/IL-1beta/TGF-beta1 signaling pathway and EMT process.

      differentiation.
PG  - L111-L123

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease characterized by 
      progressive scarring of the lungs and resulting in deterioration in lung 
      function. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is one of the most established 
      drivers of fibrotic processes. TGF-beta promotes the transformation of tissue 
      fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, a key finding in the pathogenesis of pulmonary 
      fibrosis. We report here that TGF-beta robustly upregulates the expression of the 
      calcium-activated chloride channel anoctamin-1 (ANO1) in human lung fibroblasts 
      (HLFs) at mRNA and protein levels. ANO1 is readily detected in fibrotic areas of 
      IPF lungs in the same area with smooth muscle alpha-actin (SMA)-positive 
      myofibroblasts. TGF-beta-induced myofibroblast differentiation (determined by the 
      expression of SMA, collagen-1, and fibronectin) is significantly inhibited by a 
      specific ANO1 inhibitor, T16A(inh)-A01, or by siRNA-mediated ANO1 knockdown. 
      T16A(inh)-A01 and ANO1 siRNA attenuate profibrotic TGF-beta signaling, including 
      activation of RhoA pathway and AKT, without affecting initial Smad2 
      phosphorylation. Mechanistically, TGF-beta treatment of HLFs results in a 
      significant increase in intracellular chloride levels, which is prevented by 
      T16A(inh)-A01 or by ANO1 knockdown. The downstream mechanism involves the 
      chloride-sensing "with-no-lysine (K)" kinase (WNK1). WNK1 siRNA significantly 
      attenuates TGF-beta-induced myofibroblast differentiation and signaling (RhoA 
      pathway and AKT), whereas the WNK1 kinase inhibitor WNK463 is largely 
      ineffective. Together, these data demonstrate that 1) ANO1 is a TGF-beta-inducible 
      chloride channel that contributes to increased intracellular chloride 
      concentration in response to TGF-beta; and 2) ANO1 mediates TGF-beta-induced 
      myofibroblast differentiation and fibrotic signaling in a manner dependent on 
      WNK1 protein but independent of WNK1 kinase activity.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study 
      describes a novel mechanism of differentiation of human lung fibroblasts (HLFs) 
      to myofibroblasts: the key process in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. 
      Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) drives the expression of calcium-activated 
      chloride channel anoctmin-1 (ANO1) leading to an increase in intracellular levels 
      of chloride. The latter recruits chloride-sensitive with-no-lysine (K) kinase 
      (WNK1) to activate profibrotic RhoA and AKT signaling pathways, possibly through 
      activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex-2 (mTORC2), altogether 
      promoting myofibroblast differentiation.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal and devastating lung disease of 
      unknown etiology, described as the result of multiple cycles of epithelial cell 
      injury and fibroblast activation. Despite this impressive increase in 
      understanding, a therapy that reverses this form of fibrosis remains elusive. In 
      our previous study, we found that miR-29b has a therapeutic effect on pulmonary 
      fibrosis. However, its anti-fibrotic mechanism is not yet clear. Recently, our 
      study identified that F-Actin Binding Protein (TRIOBP) is one of the target genes 
      of miR-29b and found that deficiency of TRIOBP increases resistance to lung 
      fibrosis in vivo. TRIOBP knockdown inhibited the proliferation of epithelial 
      cells and attenuated the activation of fibroblasts. In addition, deficiency of 
      Trio Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor (TRIO) in epithelial cells and 
      fibroblasts decreases susceptibility to lung fibrosis. TRIOBP interacting with 
      TRIO promoted abnormal epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk and modulated the 
      nucleocytoplasmic translocation of beta-catenin. We concluded that the 
      miR-29b‒TRIOBP-TRIO-beta-catenin axis might be a key anti-fibrotic axis in IPF to 
      regulate lung regeneration and fibrosis, which may provide a promising treatment 
      strategy for lung fibrosis.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is considered as a chronic, fibrosing 
      interstitial pneumonia with unknown mechanism. The present work aimed to explore 
      the function, biogenesis and regulatory mechanism of circELP2 in pulmonary 
      fibrosis and evaluate the value of blocking circELP2-medicated signal pathway for 
      IPF treatment. The results showed that heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L 
      initiated reverse splicing of circELP2 resulting in the increase of circELP2 
      generation. The biogenetic circELP2 activated the abnormal proliferation and 
      migration of fibroblast and extracellular matrix deposition to promote pulmonary 
      fibrogenesis. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that cytoplasmic circELP2 sponged 
      miR-630 to increase transcriptional co-activators Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) 
      and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). Then, YAP1/TAZ 
      bound to the promoter regions of their target genes, such as mTOR, Raptor and 
      mLST8, which in turn activated or inhibited the genes expression in mitochondrial 
      quality control pathway. Finally, the overexpressed circELP2 and miR-630 mimic 
      were packaged into adenovirus vector for spraying into the mice lung to evaluate 
      therapeutic effect of blocking circELP2-miR-630-YAP1/TAZ-mitochondrial quality 
      control pathway in vivo. In conclusion, blocking circELP2-medicated pathway can 
      alleviate pulmonary fibrosis, and circELP2 may be a potential target to treat 
      lung fibrosis.

      fibrosis progression.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive lung disorder involving 
      scarring of pulmonary tissue and a subsequent decrease in respiratory capacity, 
      ultimately resulting in death. Tartrate resistant acid phosphatase 5 (ACP5) plays 
      a role in IPF but the exact mechanisms are yet to be elucidated. In this study, 
      we have utilized various perturbations of the bleomycin mouse model of IPF 
      including genetic knockout, RANKL inhibition, and macrophage adoptive transfer to 
      further understand ACP5's role in pulmonary fibrosis. Genetic ablation of Acp5 
      decreased immune cell recruitment to the lungs and reduced the levels of 
      hydroxyproline (reflecting extracellular matrix-production) as well as 
      histological damage. Additionally, gene expression profiling of murine lung 
      tissue revealed downregulation of genes including Ccl13, Mmp13, and Il-1alpha that 
      encodes proteins specifically related to immune cell recruitment and 
      macrophage/fibroblast interactions. Furthermore, antibody-based neutralization of 
      RANKL, an important inducer of Acp5 expression, reduced immune cell recruitment 
      but did not decrease fibrotic lung development. Adoptive transfer of Acp5(-/-) 
      bone marrow-derived monocyte (BMDM) macrophages 7 or 14 days after bleomycin 
      administration resulted in reductions of cytokine production and decreased levels 
      of lung damage, compared to adoptive transfer of WT control macrophages. Taken 
      together, the data presented in this study suggest that macrophage derived ACP5 
      plays an important role in development of pulmonary fibrosis and could present a 
      tractable target for therapeutic intervention in IPF.

AB  - Chronic inflammation and dysregulated repair mechanisms after epithelial damage 
      have been implicated in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, 
      the lack of ex vivo-models that accurately reflect multicellular lung tissue 
      hinders our understanding of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions in COPD. Through 
      a combination of transcriptomic and proteomic approaches applied to a 
      sophisticated in vitro iPSC-alveolosphere with fibroblasts model, 
      epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk was explored in COPD and following SARS-CoV-2 
      infection. These experiments profiled dynamic changes at single-cell level of the 
      SARS-CoV-2-infected alveolar niche that unveiled the complexity of aberrant 
      inflammatory responses, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell death in COPD, which 
      provides deeper insights into the accentuated tissue 
      damage/inflammation/remodeling observed in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
      Importantly, this 3D system allowed for the evaluation of ACE2-neutralizing 
      antibodies and confirmed the potency of this therapy to prevent SARS-CoV-2 
      infection in the alveolar niche. Thus, iPSC-alveolosphere cultured with 
      fibroblasts provides a promising model to investigate disease-specific mechanisms 
      and to develop novel therapeutics.

TI  - The Plastic Interplay between Lung Regeneration Phenomena and Fibrotic Evolution: 
      Current Challenges and Novel Therapeutic Perspectives.
LID - 10.3390/ijms25010547 [doi]
LID - 547
AB  - Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are a heterogeneous group of pulmonary 
      disorders characterized by variable degrees of inflammation, interstitial 
      thickening, and fibrosis leading to distortion of the pulmonary architecture and 
      gas exchange impairment. Among them, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) displays 
      the worst prognosis. The only therapeutic options consist of the two antifibrotic 
      drugs, pirfenidone and nintedanib, which limit fibrosis progression but do not 
      reverse the lung damage. The shift of the pathogenetic paradigm from inflammatory 
      disease to epithelium-derived disease has definitively established the primary 
      role of type II alveolar cells, which lose their epithelial phenotype and acquire 
      a mesenchymal phenotype with production of collagen and extracellular matrix 
      (EMC) deposition. Some predisposing environmental and genetic factors (e.g., 
      smoke, pollution, gastroesophageal reflux, variants of telomere and surfactant 
      genes) leading to accelerated senescence set a pro-fibrogentic microenvironment 
      and contribute to the loss of regenerative properties of type II epithelial cells 
      in response to pathogenic noxae. This review provides a complete overview of the 
      different pathogenetic mechanisms leading to the development of IPF. Then, we 
      summarize the currently approved therapies and the main clinical trials ongoing. 
      Finally, we explore the potentialities offered by agents not only interfering 
      with the processes of fibrosis but also restoring the physiological properties of 
      alveolar regeneration, with a particular focus on potentialities and concerns 
      about cell therapies based on mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), whose 
      anti-inflammatory and immunomodulant properties have been exploited in other 
      fibrotic diseases, such as graft versus host disease (GVHD) and COVID-19-related 
      ARDS.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal lung disease with 
      clinical and pathological heterogeneity. Recent studies have identified 
      cuproptosis as a novel cell death mechanism. However, the role of 
      cuproptosis-related genes in the pathogenesis of IPF is still unclear. Two IPF 
      datasets of the Gene Expression Omnibus database were studied. Mann-Whitney U 
      test, correlation analysis, functional enrichment analyses, single-sample gene 
      set enrichment analysis, CIBERSORT, unsupervised clustering, weighted gene 
      co-expression network analysis, and receiver operating characteristic curve 
      analysis were used to conduct our research. The dysregulated cuproptosis-related 
      genes and immune responses were identified between IPF patients and controls. Two 
      cuproptosis-related molecular clusters were established in IPF, the high immune 
      score group (C1) and the low immune score group (C2). Significant heterogeneity 
      in immunity between clusters was revealed by functional analyses results. The 
      module genes with the strongest correlation to the 2 clusters were identified by 
      weighted gene co-expression network analysis results. Seven hub genes were found 
      using the Cytoscape software. Ultimately, 2 validated diagnostic biomarkers of 
      IPF, CDKN2A and NEDD4, were obtained. Subsequently, the results were validated in 
      GSE47460. Our investigation illustrates that CDKN2A and NEDD4 may be valid 
      biomarkers that were useful for IPF diagnosis and copper-related clustering.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary fibrosis is a terminal lung disease characterized by 
      fibroblast proliferation, extracellular matrix accumulation, inflammatory damage, 
      and tissue structure destruction. The pathogenesis of this disease, particularly 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), remains unknown. Macrophages play major 
      roles in organ fibrosis diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis. The phenotype and 
      polarization of macrophages are closely associated with pulmonary fibrosis. A new 
      direction in research on anti-pulmonary fibrosis is focused on developing drugs 
      that maintain the stability of the pulmonary microenvironment. METHODS: We 
      obtained gene sequencing data and clinical information for patients with IPF from 
      the GEO datasets GSE110147, GSE15197, GSE24988, GSE31934, GSE32537, GSE35145, 
      GSE53845, GSE49072, GSE70864, and GSE90010. We performed GO, KEGG enrichment 
      analysis and GSEA analysis, and conducted weighted gene co-expression network 
      analysis. In addition, we performed proteomic analysis of mouse lung tissue. To 
      verify the results of bioinformatics analysis and proteomic analysis, mice were 
      induced by intratracheal instillation of bleomycin (BLM), and gavaged for 14 days 
      after modeling. Respiratory function of mice in different groups was measured. 
      Lung tissues were retained for histopathological examination, Western Blot and 
      real-time quantitative PCR, etc. In addition, lipopolysaccharide, interferon-gamma 
      and interleukin-4 were used to induce RAW264.7 cells for 12h in vitro to 
      establish macrophage inflammation and polarization model. At the same time, HG2 
      intervention was given. The phenotype transformation and cytokine secretion of 
      macrophages were investigated by Western Blot, RT-qPCR and flow cytometry, etc. 
      RESULTS: Through bioinformatics analysis and experiments involving 
      bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice, we confirmed the importance of 
      macrophage polarization in IPF. The analysis revealed that macrophage 
      polarization in IPF involves a change in the phenotypic spectrum. Furthermore, 
      experiments demonstrated high expression of M2-type macrophage-associated 
      biomarkers and inducible nitric oxide synthase, thus indicating an imbalance in 
      M1/M2 polarization of pulmonary macrophages in mice with pulmonary fibrosis. 
      DISCUSSION: Our investigation revealed that the ethyl acetate extract (HG2) 
      obtained from the roots of Prismatomeris connata Y. Z. Ruan exhibits therapeutic 
      efficacy against bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. HG2 modulates macrophage 
      polarization, alterations in the TGF-beta/Smad pathway, and downstream protein 
      expression in the context of pulmonary fibrosis. On the basis of our findings, we 
      believe that HG2 has potential as a novel traditional Chinese medicine component 
      for treating pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous observational studies have investigated the association 
      between endocrine and metabolic factors and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), 
      yet have produced inconsistent results. Therefore, it is imperative to employ the 
      Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis method to conduct a more comprehensive 
      investigation into the impact of endocrine and metabolic factors on IPF. METHODS: 
      The instrumental variables (IVs) for 53 endocrine and metabolic factors were 
      sourced from publicly accessible genome-wide association study (GWAS) databases, 
      with GWAS summary statistics pertaining to IPF employed as the dependent 
      variables. Causal inference analysis encompassed the utilization of three 
      methods: inverse-variance weighted (IVW), weighted median (WM), and MR-Egger. 
      Sensitivity analysis incorporated the implementation of MR-PRESSO and 
      leave-one-out techniques to identify potential pleiotropy and outliers. The 
      presence of horizontal pleiotropy and heterogeneity was evaluated through the 
      MR-Egger intercept and Cochran's Q statistic, respectively. RESULTS: The IVW 
      method results reveal correlations between 11 traits and IPF. After correcting 
      for multiple comparisons, seven traits remain statistically significant. These 
      factors include: "Weight" (OR= 1.44; 95% CI: 1.16, 1.78; P=8.71x10(-4)), "Body 
      mass index (BMI)" (OR= 1.35; 95% CI: 1.13, 1.62; P=1x10(-3)), "Whole body fat 
      mass" (OR= 1.40; 95% CI: 1.14, 1.74; P=1.72x10(-3)), "Waist circumference (WC)" 
      (OR= 1.54; 95% CI: 1.16, 2.05; P=3.08x10(-3)), "Trunk fat mass (TFM)" (OR=1.35; 
      95% CI: 1.10,1.65; P=3.45x10(-3)), "Body fat percentage (BFP)" (OR= 1.55; 95% CI: 
      1.15,2.08; P=3.86x10(-3)), "Apoliprotein B (ApoB)" (OR= 0.78; 95% CI: 0.65,0.93; 
      P=5.47x10(-3)). Additionally, the sensitivity analysis results confirmed the 
      reliability of the MR results. CONCLUSION: The present study identified causal 
      relationships between seven traits and IPF. Specifically, ApoB exhibited a 
      negative impact on IPF, while the remaining six factors demonstrated a positive 
      impact. These findings offer novel insights into the underlying etiopathological 
      mechanisms associated with IPF.

AB  - Air pollution has greatly increased the risk of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
      (IPF). Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been found to play a significant role in the 
      advancement of IPF, but there is limited evidence of correlation between circRNAs 
      and lung epithelial cells (LECs) in IPF. This research aimed to explore the 
      influence of circRNAs on the regulation of EMT progression in LECs, with the 
      objective of elucidating its mechanism and establishing its association with IPF. 
      Our results suggested that the downregulation of circGRHPR in peripheral blood of 
      clinical cases was associated with the diagnosis of IPF. Meanwhile, we found that 
      circGRHPR was downregulated in transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1)-induced 
      A549 and Beas-2b cells. It is a valid model to study the abnormal EMT progression 
      of IPF-associated LECs in vitro. The overexpression of circGRHPR inhibited the 
      abnormal EMT progression of TGF-beta1-induced LECs. Furthermore, as the sponge of 
      miR-665, circGRHPR released the expression of E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase 
      NEDD4-like (NEDD4L), thus promoting its downstream transforming growth factor 
      beta receptor 2 (TGFBR2) ubiquitination. It is helpful to reduce the response of 
      LECs to TGF-beta1 signaling. In summary, circGRHPR/miR-665/NEDD4L axis inhibited the 
      abnormal EMT progression of TGF-beta1-induced LECs by promoting TGFBR2 
      ubiquitination, which provides new ideas and potential targets for the treatment 
      of IPF.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive 
      interstitial lung disease. This study aimed to investigate the involvement of 
      endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) in IPF and explore its correlation with immune 
      infiltration. METHODS: ERS-related differentially expressed genes (ERSRDEGs) were 
      identified by intersecting differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from three Gene 
      Expression Omnibus datasets with ERS-related gene sets. Gene Set Variation 
      Analysis and Gene Ontology were used to explore the potential biological 
      mechanisms underlying ERS. A nomogram was developed using the risk signature 
      derived from the ERSRDEGs to perform risk assessment. The diagnostic value of the 
      risk signature was evaluated using receiver operating characteristics, 
      calibration, and decision curve analyses. The ERS score of patients with IPF was 
      measured using a single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) algorithm. 
      Subsequently, a prognostic model based on the ERS scores was established. The 
      proportion of immune cell infiltration was assessed using the ssGSEA and 
      CIBERSORT algorithms. Finally, the expression of ERSRDEGs was validated in vivo 
      and in vitro via RT-qPCR. RESULTS: This study developed an 8-ERSRDEGs signature. 
      Based on the expression of these genes, we constructed a diagnostic nomogram 
      model in which agouti-related neuropeptide had a significantly greater impact on 
      the model. The area under the curve values for the predictive value of the 
      ERSRDEGs signature were 0.975 and 1.000 for GSE70866 and GSE110147, respectively. 
      We developed a prognostic model based on the ERS scores of patients with IPF. 
      Furthermore, we classified patients with IPF into two subtypes based on their 
      signatures. The RT-qPCR validation results supported the reliability of most of 
      our conclusions. CONCLUSION: We developed and verified a risk model using eight 
      ERSRDEGs. These eight genes can potentially affect the progression of IPF by 
      regulating ERS and immune responses.

AB  - Standigm ASK revolutionizes healthcare by addressing the critical challenge of 
      identifying pivotal target genes in disease mechanisms-a fundamental aspect of 
      drug development success. Standigm ASK integrates a unique combination of a 
      heterogeneous knowledge graph (KG) database and an attention-based neural network 
      model, providing interpretable subgraph evidence. Empowering users through an 
      interactive interface, Standigm ASK facilitates the exploration of predicted 
      results. Applying Standigm ASK to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a complex 
      lung disease, we focused on genes (AMFR, MDFIC and NR5A2) identified through KG 
      evidence. In vitro experiments demonstrated their relevance, as TGFbeta treatment 
      induced gene expression changes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition 
      characteristics. Gene knockdown reversed these changes, identifying AMFR, MDFIC 
      and NR5A2 as potential therapeutic targets for IPF. In summary, Standigm ASK 
      emerges as an innovative KG and artificial intelligence platform driving insights 
      in drug target discovery, exemplified by the identification and validation of 
      therapeutic targets for IPF.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) encompasses a diverse group of 
      disorders characterized by chronic inflammation and fibrosis of the pulmonary 
      interstitium. Three ILDs, namely idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), fibrotic 
      hypersensitivity pneumonitis (fHP), and connective tissue disease-associated ILD 
      (CTD-ILD), exhibit similar progressive fibrosis phenotypes, yet possess distinct 
      etiologies, encouraging us to explore their different underlying mechanisms. 
      METHODS: Transcriptome data of fibrotic lung tissues from patients with IPF, fHP, 
      and CTD-ILD were subjected to functional annotation, network, and pathway 
      analyses. Additionally, we employed the xCell deconvolution algorithm to predict 
      immune cell infiltration in patients with fibrotic ILDs and healthy controls. 
      RESULTS: We identified a shared progressive fibrosis-related module in these 
      diseases which was related to extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation and 
      production and potentially regulated by the p53 family transcription factors. In 
      IPF, neuron-related processes emerged as a critical specific mechanism in 
      functional enrichment. In fHP, we observed that B cell signaling and 
      immunoglobulin A (IgA) production may act as predominant processes, which was 
      further verified by B cell infiltration and the central role of CD19 gene. In 
      CTD-ILD, active chemokine processes were enriched, and active dendritic cells 
      (aDCs) were predicted to infiltrate the lung tissues. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      revealed shared and specific molecular and cellular pathways among IPF, fHP, and 
      CTD-ILD, providing a basis for understanding their pathogenesis and identifying 
      potential therapeutic targets.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by progressive 
      lung dysfunction due to excessive collagen production and tissue scarring. 
      Despite recent advancements, the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. METHODS: 
      RNA sequencing identified 475 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the 
      TGF-beta1-induced primary lung fibrosis model. Gene expression chips GSE101286 and 
      GSE110147 from NCBI gene expression omnibus (GEO) database were analyzed using 
      GEO2R, revealing 94 DEGs in IPF lung tissue samples. The gene ontology (GO) and 
      pathway enrichment, Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, and 
      Maximal Clique Centrality (MCC) scoring were performed. Experimental validation 
      included RT-qPCR, Immunohistochemistry (IHC), and Western Blot, with siRNA used 
      for gene knockdown. A co-expression network was constructed by GeneMANIA. 
      RESULTS: GO enrichment highlighted significant enrichment of DEGs in TGF-beta 
      cellular response, connective tissue development, extracellular matrix 
      components, and signaling pathways such as the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway and 
      ECM-receptor interaction. PPI network analysis identified hub genes, including 
      FN1, COL1A1, POSTN, KIF11, and ECT2. CALD1 (Caldesmon 1), CDH2 (Cadherin 2), and 
      POSTN (Periostin) were identified as dysregulated hub genes in both the RNA 
      sequencing and GEO datasets. Validation experiments confirmed the upregulation of 
      CALD1, CDH2, and POSTN in TGF-beta1-treated fibroblasts and IPF lung tissue samples. 
      IHC experiments probed tissue-level expression patterns of these three molecules. 
      Knockdown of CALD1, CDH2, and POSTN attenuated the expression of fibrotic markers 
      (collagen I and alpha-SMA) in response to TGF-beta1 stimulation in primary fibroblasts. 
      Co-expression analysis revealed interactions between hub genes and predicted 
      genes involved in actin cytoskeleton regulation and cell-cell junction 
      organization. CONCLUSIONS: CALD1, CDH2, and POSTN, identified as potential 
      contributors to pulmonary fibrosis, present promising therapeutic targets for IPF 
      patients.

TI  - Localized Administration of Bcar3 siRNA via Nano-Self-Assembly to Treat 
      Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis by Disrupting Macrophage-Fibroblast Crosstalk.
PG  - 1827-1842
LID - 10.2147/IJN.S444470 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a severe interstitial lung 
      disease characterized by chronic lung injury leading to macrophage infiltration 
      and fibroblast activation. However, there is no effective therapeutic strategy 
      targeting the crucial crosstalk between macrophages and fibroblasts to halt IPF 
      progression. METHODS: Studies were conducted in IPF patients and fibrotic mice 
      models to elucidate the role of Bcar3 in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. 
      The effect of Bcar3 on macrophage polarization, fibroblast activation, and 
      related signaling pathways were next investigated to unravel the underlying 
      mechanisms. RESULTS: Our study elucidates a marked increase in Bcar3 expression 
      in lung tissues from IPF patients and fibrotic mice, recording 1.7 and 7.8-fold 
      increases compared to control subjects, respectively. Additionally, Bcar3 was 
      found to significantly enhance macrophage activation and fibroblast 
      differentiation, observable in both in vivo and in vitro settings. 
      Mechanistically, the upregulation of Bcar3 in macrophages was reliant on Stat6, 
      while in fibroblasts, it depended on TGFbetaR1/Smad3. Furthermore, Bcar3 augmented 
      IL-4/Stat6 pathway in macrophages and TGF-beta/Smad3 pathway in fibroblasts, 
      supporting a synergistic activation loop that expedited lung fibrogenesis. 
      Notably, intratracheal injection of liposomes containing Bcar3 siRNA precisely 
      delivered gene therapeutics to lung macrophages and fibroblasts, effectively 
      reducing Bcar3 expression to 59% of baseline levels. Importantly, this 
      intervention protected mice from lung fibrosis induced by either FITC or 
      bleomycin, as well as human precision-cut lung slices against TGF-beta1 stimulation. 
      CONCLUSION: Our study underscores the pivotal role of Bcar3 in orchestrating the 
      macrophage-fibroblast crosstalk during pulmonary fibrosis progression. Targeting 
      Bcar3 emerges as a novel therapeutic avenue to halt IPF progression and enhance 
      patient prognosis.

      against pulmonary fibrosis by downregulating Runx1 via Spred2.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic pulmonary fibrosis disease that 
      is fatal. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-secreted exosomes (exos) have been linked 
      to improving PF. Moreover, exosomal microRNAs (miRs) can control the growth of 
      numerous diseases, including lung disorders. Our bioinformatics analysis showed 
      that miR-30b was downregulated in tissue samples from surgical remnants of 
      biopsies or lungs explanted from patients with IPF who underwent pulmonary 
      transplantation. This suggests that miR-30b plays an important role in both the 
      pathogenesis and treatment of IPF. Herein, this research was designed to 
      ascertain the mechanism of MSCs-exos-packaged miR-30b in alleviating PF. The 
      serum was harvested from idiopathic PF (IPF) patients with interstitial pneumonia 
      caused by dermatomyositis and the MLE12 lung epithelial cell fibrosis model was 
      built with TGF-beta1 (10 ng/mL), followed by miR-30b expression determination. 
      TGF-beta1-stimulated MLE12 cells were co-incubated with exos from MSCs with or 
      without Spred2 or Runx1 overexpression, followed by measurement of cell viability 
      and apoptosis. After establishing the IPF mouse model with bleomycin and 
      injecting exos and/or silencing and overexpressing adenovirus vectors, fibrosis 
      evaluation was conducted. In mice and cells, the expression of TGF-beta1, TNF-alpha, and 
      IL-1beta was tested via ELISA, and the levels of E-cad, ZO-1, alpha-SMA, and collagen 
      type I via western blot analysis. The promoters of miR-30b, Runx1, and Spred2 
      were investigated. miR-30b was downregulated in the serum of IPF patients and 
      TGF-beta1-stimulated MLE12 cells. Mechanistically, miR-30b inhibited Spred2 
      transcription by negatively targeting Runx1. MSCs-exos or MSCs-exo-miR-30b 
      decreased the apoptosis, inflammation, and fibrosis while increasing their 
      viability in TGF-beta1-stimulated MLE12 cells, which was annulled by overexpressing 
      Runx1 or Spred2. Exo-miR-30b decreased Runx1 expression to downregulate Spred2, 
      reducing fibrosis and inflammation in IPF mice. Our results indicated that 
      MSCs-exos-encapsulated miR-30b had a potential function to inhibit PF and part of 
      its function may be achieved by targeting RUNX1 to reduce the Spred2 
      transcription level. Moreover, this work offered evidence and therapeutic targets 
      for therapeutic strategies for managing clinical PF in patients.

TI  - The spread of pESI-mediated extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance in 
      Salmonella serovars-Infantis, Senftenberg, and Alachua isolated from food animal 
      sources in the United States.

AB  - The goal of this study is to investigate the origin, prevalence, and evolution of 
      the pESI megaplasmid in Salmonella isolated from animals, foods, and humans. We 
      queried 510,097 Salmonella genomes under the National Center for Biotechnology 
      Information (NCBI) Pathogen Detection (PD) database for the presence of potential 
      sequences containing the pESI plasmid in animal, food, and environmental sources. 
      The presence of the pESI megaplasmid was confirmed by using seven 
      plasmid-specific markers (rdA, pilL, SogS, TrbA, ipf, ipr2 and IncFIB(pN55391)). 
      The plasmid and chromosome phylogeny of these isolates was inferred from single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Our search resolved six Salmonella clusters 
      carrying the pESI plasmid. Four were emergent Salmonella Infantis clusters, and 
      one each belonged to serovar Senftenberg and Alachua. The Infantis cluster with a 
      pESI plasmid carrying blaCTX-M-65 gene was the biggest of the four emergent 
      Infantis clusters, with over 10,000 isolates. This cluster was first detected in 
      South America and has since spread widely in United States. Over time the 
      composition of pESI in United States has changed with the average number of 
      resistance genes showing a decrease from 9 in 2014 to 5 in 2022, resulting from 
      changes in gene content in two integrons present in the plasmid. A recent and 
      emerging cluster of Senftenberg, which carries the blaCTX-M-65 gene and is 
      primarily associated with turkey sources, was the second largest in the United 
      States. SNP analysis showed that this cluster likely originated in North Carolina 
      with the recent acquisition of the pESI plasmid. A single Alachua isolate from 
      turkey was also found to carry the pESI plasmid containing blaCTX-M-65 gene. The 
      study of the pESI plasmid, its evolution and mechanism of spread can help us in 
      developing appropriate strategies for the prevention and further spread of this 
      multi-drug resistant plasmid in Salmonella in poultry and humans.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease with a 
      five-year survival rate of less than 40%. There is significant variability in 
      survival time among IPF patients, but the underlying mechanisms for this are not 
      clear yet. METHODS AND RESULTS: We collected single-cell RNA sequence data of 
      13,223 epithelial cells taken from 32 IPF patients and bulk RNA sequence data 
      from 456 IPF patients in GEO. Based on unsupervised clustering analysis at the 
      single-cell level and deconvolution algorithm at bulk RNA sequence data, we 
      discovered a special alveolar type 2 cell subtype characterized by high 
      expression of CCL20 (referred to as ATII-CCL20), and found that IPF patients with 
      a higher proportion of ATII-CCL20 had worse prognoses. Furthermore, we uncovered 
      the upregulation of immune cell infiltration and metabolic functions in IPF 
      patients with a higher proportion of ATII-CCL20. Finally, the comprehensive 
      decision tree and nomogram were constructed to optimize the risk stratification 
      of IPF patients and provide a reference for accurate prognosis evaluation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study by integrating single-cell and bulk RNA sequence data from 
      IPF patients identified a special subtype of ATII cells, ATII-CCL20, which was 
      found to be a risk cell subtype associated with poor prognosis in IPF patients. 
      More importantly, the ATII-CCL20 cell subtype was linked with metabolic functions 
      and immune infiltration.

LID - e18191
AB  - Epigenetic modifications are involved in fibrotic diseases, such as idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and contribute to the silencing of anti-fibrotic genes. 
      H3K27me3, a key repressive histone mark, is catalysed by the methyltransferase 
      enhancer of Zeste homologue 2 (EZH2), which is regulated by the 
      post-translational modification, O-linked N-Acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc). In this 
      study, we explored the effects of O-GlcNAc and EZH2 on the expression of 
      antifibrotic genes, cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox2) and Heme Oxygenase (Homx1). The 
      expression of Cox2 and Hmox1 was examined in primary IPF or non-IPF lung 
      fibroblasts with or without EZH2 inhibitor EZP6438, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) 
      inhibitor (OSMI-1) or O-GlcNAcase (OGA) inhibitor (thiamet G). Non-IPF cells were 
      also subjected to TGF-beta1 with or without OGT inhibition. The reduced expression 
      of Cox2 and Hmox1 in IPF lung fibroblasts is restored by OGT inhibition. In 
      non-IPF fibroblasts, TGF-beta1 treatment reduces Cox2 and Hmox1 expression, which 
      was restored by OGT inhibition. ChIP assays demonstrated that the association of 
      H3K27me3 is reduced at the Cox2 and Hmox1 promoter regions following OGT or EZH2 
      inhibition. EZH2 levels and stability were decreased by reducing O-GlcNAc. Our 
      study provided a novel mechanism of O-GlcNAc modification in regulating 
      anti-fibrotic genes in lung fibroblasts and in the pathogenesis of IPF.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The potential pathogenic mechanism of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
      is widely recognized to involve immune dysregulation. However, the current pool 
      of studies has yet to establish a unanimous agreement regarding the correlation 
      between various types of immune cells and IPF. METHODS: By conducting a 
      two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis using publicly available genetic 
      data, the study examined the causal relationship between IPF and 731 immune 
      cells. To ensure the reliability of the results, combined sensitivity analyses 
      and inverse Mendelian analyses were conducted. Moreover, within subgroups, 
      multivariate Mendelian randomization analyses were utilized to investigate the 
      autonomous causal connection between immune cell characteristics and IPF. 
      RESULTS: After adjusting for false discovery rate, it was discovered that 20 
      immunophenotypes exhibited a significant association with IPF. After subgrouping 
      for multivariate Mendelian randomization analysis, there were six 
      immunophenotypes that remained significantly associated with IPF. These included 
      CD33 + HLA DR + CD14dim (OR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.93-0.99, P = 0.033), HLA DR + NK 
      (OR = 0.92, 95% CI 0.85-0.98, P = 0.017), CD39 + CD8 + T cell %T cell (OR = 0.93, 
      95% CI 0.88-0.99, P = 0.024), CD3 on activated & secreting Treg (OR = 0.91, 95% 
      CI 0.84-0.98, P = 0.026), PDL-1 on CD14- CD16 + monocyte (OR = 0.89, 95% CI 
      0.84-0.95, P = 8 x 10(-4)), and CD45 on CD33 + HLA DR + CD14- (OR = 1.08, 95% CI 
      1.01-1.15, P = 0.011). CONCLUSION: Our study reveals a noteworthy association 
      between IPF and various immune cells, providing valuable insights for clinical 
      research and aiding the advancement of immunologically-based therapeutic 
      strategies.

TI  - Identification of non-coding RNA signatures in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 1923-1927
LID - 10.1007/s11845-024-03675-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a deadly, chronic, 
      progressive, irreversible interstitial lung disease characterized by the 
      formation of scar tissue resulting in permanent lung damage. The average survival 
      time following diagnosis is only 3-5 years, with a 5-year survival rate shorter 
      than that of many cancers. Alveolar epithelial cell injury followed by irregular 
      repair is the primary pathological process observed in patients with IPF. An 
      evident characteristic of IPF is the development of fibroblastic foci 
      representing active fibrotic areas. Most of the cells within these foci are 
      believed to be myofibroblasts, which are thought to be the primary source of 
      abnormal extracellular matrix production in IPF. The lung phenotype in IPF is 
      characterized by significantly different processes from healthy lungs, including 
      irregular apoptosis, oxidative stress, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition 
      (EMT) pathways. AIMS: The exact cause of IPF is not fully understood and remains 
      mysterious. It is not suppressing that non-coding RNAs are involved in the 
      development and progression of IPF. Accordingly, here we aimed to identify 
      non-coding RNA molecules during TGFbeta-induced myofibroblast activation. METHODS: 
      Differential expression and functional enrichment analysis were employed to 
      reveal the impact of non-coding RNAs during TGFbeta-associated lung fibrosis. 
      RESULTS: Remarkably, LOC101448202, CZ1P-ASNS, LINC01503, IER3-AS1, MIR503HG, 
      CLMAT3, LINC02593, ACTA2-AS1, LOC102723692, LOC107985728, and LOC105371064 were 
      identified to be differentially altered during TGFbeta-stimulated myofibroblast 
      activation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings strongly suggest that the mechanism of 
      lung fibrosis is heavily under control of non-coding RNAs, and RNA-based 
      therapies could be a promising approach for future therapeutic interventions to 
      lung fibrosis.

TI  - UNVEILING THE CAUSAL ASSOCIATION BETWEEN NONINFECTIOUS RESPIRATORY DISORDERS AND 
      SEPSIS THROUGH MENDELIAN RANDOMIZATION ANALYSIS.
PG  - 179-185
LID - 10.1097/SHK.0000000000002358 [doi]
AB  - Background: The association between sepsis and noninfectious respiratory diseases 
      is well-documented, yet the specific causal link between the two remains unclear. 
      In order to explore this relationship further, we employed a Mendelian 
      randomization (MR) analysis utilizing data from the UK Biobank and FinnGen 
      Biobank. Methods: We analyzed the summary statistics of a genome-wide association 
      study summary statistics for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 
      asthma, pulmonary embolism (PE), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), obstructive 
      sleep apnea (OSA), lung cancer, sepsis, and sepsis-related mortality. We employed 
      the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method and four additional MR methods. 
      Heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy were assessed using the Cochrane's Q 
      test, MR-Egger intercept, and MR-PRESSO test. A sensitivity analysis was also 
      performed. Results: MR analysis showed associations between COPD and lung cancer 
      with increased sepsis risk (odds ratio (OR)IVW 1.138, P = 0.006; (OR)IVW 1.123, P 
      = 0.031; respectively) and sepsis mortality ((OR)IVW 1.350, P = 0.022; (OR)IVW 
      1.312, P = 0.022; respectively). Asthma exhibited a potential protective effect 
      against sepsis mortality ((OR)IVW = 0.300, P = 0.039), while PE demonstrated a 
      risk effect ((OR)IVW = 1.148, P = 0.032). No causal association was observed 
      between asthma, PE, and sepsis ( P > 0.05). IPF and OSA were not significantly 
      associated with sepsis or sepsis-related mortality ( P > 0.05). Heterogeneity and 
      horizontal pleiotropy were not evident for asthma or lung cancer ( P > 0.05). 
      However, horizontal pleiotropy was suggested for COPD by the MR-Egger regression 
      ( P < 0.05), but not by the MR-PRESSO test ( P > 0.05). IPF and OSA were not 
      significantly associated with sepsis or sepsis-related mortality ( P > 0.05). 
      Conclusion: Our MR analysis offers new insights into potential links between 
      noninfectious respiratory diseases and the risk of sepsis. However, additional 
      investigation into the underlying mechanisms and clinical studies are necessary 
      to confirm these findings.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a common and heterogeneous chronic 
      disease, and the mechanism of Jinshui Huanxian formula (JHF) on IPF remains 
      unclear. For a total of 385 lung normal tissue samples from the Gene Expression 
      Omnibus database, 37,777,639 gene pairs were identified through microarray and 
      RNA-seq platforms. Using the individualized differentially expressed gene (DEG) 
      analysis algorithm RankComp (FDR < 0.01), we identified 344 genes as DEGs in at 
      least 95 % (n = 81) of the IPF samples. Of these genes, IGF1, IFNGR1, GLI2, 
      HMGCR, DNM1, KIF4A, and TNFRSF11A were identified as hub genes. These genes were 
      verified using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 
      (qRT-PCR) in mice with pulmonary fibrosis (PF) and MRC-5 cells, and they were 
      highly effective at classifying IPF samples in the independent dataset GSE134692 
      (AUC = 0.587-0.788) and mice with PF (AUC = 0.806-1.000). Moreover, JHF 
      ameliorated the pathological changes in mice with PF and significantly reversed 
      the changes in hub gene expression (KIF4A, IFNGR1, and HMGCR). In conclusion, a 
      series of IPF hub genes was identified, and validated in an independent dataset, 
      mice with PF, and MRC-5 cells. Moreover, the abnormal gene expression was 
      normalized by JHF. These findings provide guidance for further exploration of the 
      pathogenesis and treatment of IPF.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that mitochondrial function and macrophages may 
      play a role in the development of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, 
      the understanding of the interactions and specific mechanisms between 
      mitochondrial function and macrophages in pulmonary fibrosis is still very 
      limited. METHODS: To construct a prognostic model for IPF based on Macrophage- 
      related genes (MaRGs) and Mitochondria-related genes (MitoRGs), differential 
      analysis was performed to achieve differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between 
      IPF and Control groups in the GSE28042 dataset. Then, MitoRGs, MaRGs and DEGs 
      were overlapped to screen out the signature genes. The univariate Cox analysis 
      and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm were 
      implemented to achieve key genes. Furthermore, the independent prognostic 
      analysis was employed. The ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) was employed to 
      further understand the molecular mechanisms of key genes.Next, the immune 
      infiltration analysis was implemented to identify differential immune cells 
      between two risk subgroups. RESULTS: There were 4791 DEGs between IPF and Control 
      groups. Furthermore, 26 signature genes were achieved by the intersection 
      processing. Three key genes including ALDH2, MCL1, and BCL2A1 were achieved, and 
      the risk model based on the key genes was created. In addition, a nomogram for 
      survival forecasting of IPF patients was created based on riskScore, Age, and 
      Gender, and we found that key genes were associated with classical pathways 
      including 'Apoptosis Signaling', 'PI3K/AKT Signaling', and so on. Next, two 
      differential immune cells including Monocytes and CD8 T cells were identified 
      between two risk subgroups. Moreover, we found that MIR29B2CHG and hsa-mir-1-3p 
      could regulate the expression of ALDH2. CONCLUSION: We achieved 3 key genes 
      including ALDH2, MCL1,, and BCL2A1 associated with IPF, providing a new 
      theoretical basis for clinical treatment of IPF.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous metabolomic studies have confirmed the pivotal role of 
      metabolic abnormalities in the development of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
      (IPF). Nevertheless, there is a lack of evidence on the causal relationship 
      between circulating metabolites and the risk of IPF. METHODS: The potential 
      causality between 486 blood metabolites and IPF was determined through a 
      bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (TSMR) analysis. A genome-wide 
      association study (GWAS) involving 7,824 participants was performed to analyze 
      metabolite data, and a GWAS meta-analysis involving 6,257 IPF cases and 947,616 
      control European subjects was conducted to analyze IPF data. The TSMR analysis 
      was performed primarily with the inverse variance weighted model, supplemented by 
      weighted mode, MR-Egger regression, and weighted median estimators. A battery of 
      sensitivity analyses was performed, including horizontal pleiotropy assessment, 
      heterogeneity test, Steiger test, and leave-one-out analysis. Furthermore, 
      replication analysis and meta-analysis were conducted with another GWAS dataset 
      of IPF containing 4,125 IPF cases and 20,464 control subjects. Mediation analyses 
      were used to identify the mediating role of confounders in the effect of 
      metabolites on IPF. RESULTS: There were four metabolites associated with the 
      elevated risk of IPF, namely glucose (odds ratio [OR] = 2.49, 95% confidence 
      interval [95%CI] = 1.13-5.49, P = 0.024), urea (OR = 6.24, 95% CI = 1.77-22.02, P 
      = 0.004), guanosine (OR = 1.57, 95%CI = 1.07-2.30, P = 0.021), and 
      ADpSGEGDFXAEGGGVR (OR = 1.70, 95%CI = 1.00-2.88, P = 0.0496). Of note, the effect 
      of guanosine on IPF was found to be mediated by gastroesophageal reflux disease. 
      Reverse Mendelian randomization analysis displayed that IPF might slightly 
      elevate guanosine levels in the blood. CONCLUSION: Conclusively, hyperglycemia 
      may confer a promoting effect on IPF, highlighting that attention should be paid 
      to the relationship between diabetes and IPF, not solely to the diagnosis of 
      diabetes. Additionally, urea, guanosine, and ADpSGEGDFXAEGGGVR also facilitate 
      the development of IPF. This study may provide a reference for analyzing the 
      potential mechanism of IPF and carry implications for the prevention and 
      treatment of IPF.

TI  - Curcumin regulates pulmonary extracellular matrix remodeling and mitochondrial 
      function to attenuate pulmonary fibrosis by regulating the miR-29a-3p/DNMT3A 
      axis.

AB  - Epigenetic regulation and mitochondrial dysfunction are essential to the 
      progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Curcumin (CCM) in inhibits 
      the progression of pulmonary fibrosis by regulating the expression of specific 
      miRNAs and pulmonary fibroblast mitochondrial function; however, the underlying 
      mechanism is unclear. C57BL/6 mice were intratracheally injected with bleomycin 
      (5 mg/kg) and treated with CCM (25 mg/kg body weight/3 times per week, 
      intraperitoneal injection) for 28 days. Verhoeff-Van Gieson, Picro sirius red, 
      and Masson's trichrome staining were used to examine the expression and 
      distribution of collagen and elastic fibers in the lung tissue. Pulmonary 
      fibrosis was determined using micro-computed tomography and transmission electron 
      microscopy. Human pulmonary fibroblasts were transfected with miR-29a-3p, and 
      RT-qPCR, immunostaining, and western blotting were performed to determine the 
      expression of DNMT3A and extracellular matrix collagen-1 (COL1A1) and 
      fibronectin-1 (FN1) levels. The expression of mitochondrial electron transport 
      chain complex (MRC) and mitochondrial function were detected using western 
      blotting and Seahorse XFp Technology. CCM in increased the expression of 
      miR-29a-3p in the lung tissue and inhibited the DNMT3A to reduce the COL1A1 and 
      FN1 levels leading to pulmonary extracellular matrix remodeling. In addition, CCM 
      inhibited pulmonary fibroblasts MRC and mitochondrial function via the 
      miR-29a-3p/DNMT3A pathway. CCM attenuates pulmonary fibrosis via the 
      miR-29a-3p/DNMT3A axis to regulate extracellular matrix remodeling and 
      mitochondrial function and may provide a new therapeutic intervention for 
      preventing pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - Integrin-mediated activation of the profibrotic mediator transforming growth 
      factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), plays a critical role in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) 
      pathogenesis. Galectin-3 is believed to contribute to the pathological wound 
      healing seen in IPF, although its mechanism of action is not precisely defined. 
      We hypothesized that galectin-3 potentiates TGF-beta1 activation and/or signaling in 
      the lung to promote fibrogenesis. We show that galectin-3 induces TGF-beta1 
      activation in human lung fibroblasts (HLFs) and specifically that extracellular 
      galectin-3 promotes oleoyl-L-alpha-lysophosphatidic acid sodium salt-induced 
      integrin-mediated TGF-beta1 activation. Surface plasmon resonance analysis confirmed 
      that galectin-3 binds to alphav integrins, alphavbeta1, alphavbeta5, and alphavbeta6, and to the TGFbetaRII 
      subunit in a glycosylation-dependent manner. This binding is heterogeneous and 
      not a 1:1 binding stoichiometry. Binding interactions were blocked by small 
      molecule inhibitors of galectin-3, which target the carbohydrate recognition 
      domain. Galectin-3 binding to beta1 integrin was validated in vitro by 
      coimmunoprecipitation in HLFs. Proximity ligation assays indicated that 
      galectin-3 and beta1 integrin colocalize closely (</=40 nm) on the cell surface and 
      that colocalization is increased by TGF-beta1 treatment and blocked by galectin-3 
      inhibitors. In the absence of TGF-beta1 stimulation, colocalization was detectable 
      only in HLFs from IPF patients, suggesting the proteins are inherently more 
      closely associated in the disease state. Galectin-3 inhibitor treatment of 
      precision cut lung slices from IPF patients' reduced Col1a1, TIMP1, and 
      hyaluronan secretion to a similar degree as TGF-beta type I receptor inhibitor. 
      These data suggest that galectin-3 promotes TGF-beta1 signaling and may induce 
      fibrogenesis by interacting directly with components of the TGF-beta1 signaling 
      cascade.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Abnormal lipid metabolism has recently been reported as a crucial 
      signature of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, the origin and 
      biological function of the lipid and possible mechanisms of increased lipid 
      content in the pathogenesis of IPF remains undetermined. METHODS: Oil-red 
      staining and immunofluorescence analysis were used to detect lipid accumulation 
      in mouse lung fibrosis frozen sections, Bleomycin-treated human type II alveolar 
      epithelial cells (AECIIs) and lung fibroblast. Untargeted Lipid omics analysis 
      was applied to investigate differential lipid species and identified LysoPC was 
      utilized to treat human lung fibroblasts and mice. Microarray and single-cell RNA 
      expression data sets identified lipid metabolism-related differentially expressed 
      genes. Gain of function experiment was used to study the function of 
      3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coa Synthase 2 (HMGCS2) in regulating AECIIs lipid 
      metabolism. Mice with AECII-HMGCS2 (high) were established by intratracheally 
      delivering HBAAV2/6-SFTPC- HMGCS2 adeno-associated virus. Western blot, 
      Co-immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, site-directed mutation and flow 
      cytometry were utilized to investigate the mechanisms of HMGCS2-mediated lipid 
      metabolism in AECIIs. RESULTS: Injured AECIIs were the primary source of 
      accumulated lipids in response to Bleomycin stimulation. LysoPCs released by 
      injured AECIIs could activate lung fibroblasts, thus promoting the progression of 
      pulmonary fibrosis. Mechanistically, HMGCS2 was decreased explicitly in AECIIs 
      and ectopic expression of HMGCS2 in AECIIs using the AAV system significantly 
      alleviated experimental mouse lung fibrosis progression via modulating lipid 
      degradation in AECIIs through promoting CPT1A and CPT2 expression by interacting 
      with PPARalpha. CONCLUSIONS: These data unveiled a novel etiological mechanism of 
      HMGCS2-mediated AECII lipid metabolism in the genesis and development of 
      pulmonary fibrosis and provided a novel target for clinical intervention.

TI  - O-GlcNAc transferase regulates collagen deposition and fibrosis resolution in 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic pulmonary disease 
      that is characterized by an excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) 
      proteins (e.g. collagens) in the parenchyma, which ultimately leads to 
      respiratory failure and death. While current therapies exist to slow the 
      progression, no therapies are available to resolve fibrosis. METHODS: We 
      characterized the O-linked N-Acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase 
      (OGT)/O-GlcNAc axis in IPF using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data and 
      human lung sections and isolated fibroblasts from IPF and non-IPF donors. The 
      underlying mechanism(s) of IPF were further investigated using multiple 
      experimental models to modulate collagen expression and accumulation by 
      genetically and pharmacologically targeting OGT. Furthermore, we hone in on the 
      transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) effector molecule, Smad3, by 
      co-expressing it with OGT to determine if it is modified and its subsequent 
      effect on Smad3 activation. RESULTS: We found that OGT and O-GlcNAc levels are 
      upregulated in patients with IPF compared to non-IPF. We report that the OGT 
      regulates collagen deposition and fibrosis resolution, which is an evolutionarily 
      conserved process demonstrated across multiple species. Co-expression of OGT and 
      Smad3 showed that Smad3 is O-GlcNAc modified. Blocking OGT activity resulted in 
      decreased phosphorylation at Ser-423/425 of Smad3 attenuating the effects of 
      TGF-beta1 induced collagen expression/deposition. CONCLUSION: OGT inhibition or 
      knockdown successfully blocked and reversed collagen expression and accumulation, 
      respectively. Smad3 is discovered to be a substrate of OGT and its O-GlcNAc 
      modification(s) directly affects its phosphorylation state. These data identify 
      OGT as a potential target in pulmonary fibrosis resolution, as well as other 
      diseases that might have aberrant ECM/collagen accumulation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The alveolar epithelial type II cell (AT2) and its senescence play a 
      pivotal role in alveolar damage and pulmonary fibrosis. Cell circadian rhythm is 
      strongly associated with cell senescence. Differentiated embryonic chondrocyte 
      expressed gene 1 (DEC1) is a very important circadian clock gene. However, the 
      role of DEC1 in AT2 senescence and pulmonary fibrosis was still unclear. RESULTS: 
      In this study, a circadian disruption model of light intervention was used. It 
      was found that circadian disruption exacerbated pulmonary fibrosis in mice. To 
      understand the underlying mechanism, DEC1 levels were investigated. Results 
      showed that DEC1 levels increased in lung tissues of IPF patients and in 
      bleomycin-induced mouse fibrotic lungs. In vitro study revealed that bleomycin 
      and TGF-beta1 increased the expressions of DEC1, collagen-I, and fibronectin in AT2 
      cells. Inhibition of DEC1 mitigated bleomycin-induced fibrotic changes in vitro 
      and in vivo. After that, cell senescence was observed in bleomycin-treated AT2 
      cells and mouse models, but these were prevented by DEC1 inhibition. At last, p21 
      was confirmed having circadian rhythm followed DEC1 in normal conditions. But 
      bleomycin disrupted the circadian rhythm and increased DEC1 which promoted p21 
      expression, increased p21 mediated AT2 senescence and pulmonary fibrosis. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, circadian clock protein DEC1 mediated pulmonary 
      fibrosis via p21 and cell senescence in alveolar epithelial type II cells.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and lethal lung disease 
      characterized by progressive lung scarring. This study aims to elucidate the role 
      of the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4 in the ubiquitination of YY1 and its subsequent 
      impact on TAB1 transcription, revealing a possible molecular mechanism in the 
      development of IPF. Through bioinformatics analysis and both in vitro and in vivo 
      experiments, we observed differential expression levels of NEDD4 and YY1 between 
      normal and IPF samples, identifying NEDD4 as an upstream E3 ubiquitin ligase of 
      YY1. Furthermore, binding sites for the transcription factor YY1 on the promoter 
      region of TAB1 were discovered, indicating a direct interaction. In vitro 
      experiments using HEPF cells showed that NEDD4 mediates the ubiquitination and 
      degradation of YY1, leading to suppressed TAB1 transcription, thereby inhibiting 
      cell proliferation and fibrogenesis. These findings were corroborated by in vivo 
      experiments in an IPF mouse model, where the ubiquitination pathway facilitated 
      by NEDD4 attenuated IPF progression through the downregulation of YY1 and TAB1 
      transcription. These results suggest that NEDD4 plays a crucial role in the 
      development of IPF by modulating YY1 ubiquitination and TAB1 transcription, 
      providing new insights into potential therapeutic targets for treating IPF.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are global 
      public health concerns. The relationship between HF and IPF is widely 
      acknowledged. However, the interaction mechanisms between these two diseases 
      remain unclear, and early diagnosis is particularly difficult. Through the 
      integration of bioinformatics and machine learning, our work aims to investigate 
      common gene features, putative molecular causes, and prospective diagnostic 
      indicators of IPF and HF. METHODS: The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database 
      provided the RNA-seq datasets for HF and IPF. Utilizing a weighted gene 
      co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), possible genes linked to HF and IPF were 
      found. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) 
      were then employed to analyze the genes that were shared by HF and IPF. Using the 
      cytoHubba and iRegulon algorithms, a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network 
      was built based on seven basic diagnostic indicators. Additionally, hub genes 
      were identified using machine learning approaches. External datasets were used to 
      validate the findings. Lastly, the association between the number of immune cells 
      in tissues and the discovered genes was estimated using the CIBERSORT method. 
      RESULTS: In total, 63 shared genes were identified between HF- and IPF-related 
      modules using WGCNA. Extracellular matrix (ECM)/structure organization, 
      ECM-receptor interactions, focal, and protein digestion and absorption, were 
      shown to be the most enrichment categories in GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of 
      common genes. Furthermore, a total of seven fundamental genes, including COL1A1, 
      COL3A1, THBS2, CCND1, ASPN, FAP, and S100A12, were recognized as pivotal genes 
      implicated in the shared pathophysiological pathways of HF and IPF, and TCF12 may 
      be the most important regulatory transcription factor. Two characteristic 
      molecules, CCND1 and NAP1L3, were selected as potential diagnostic markers for HF 
      and IPF, respectively, using a support vector machine-recursive feature 
      elimination (SVM-RFE) model. Furthermore, the development of diseases and 
      diagnostic markers may be associated with immune cells at varying degrees. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that ECM/structure organisation, 
      ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, and protein digestion and absorption, 
      are common pathogeneses of IPF and HF. Additionally, CCND1 and NAP1L3 were 
      identified as potential diagnostic biomarkers for both HF and IPF. The results of 
      our study contribute to the comprehension of the co-pathogenesis of HF and IPF at 
      the genetic level and offer potential biological indicators for the early 
      detection of both conditions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiological evidence has indicated the occurrence of idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) with coexisting lung cancer is not a coincidence. The 
      pathogenic mechanisms shared between IPF and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
      at the transcriptional level remain elusive and need to be further elucidated. 
      METHODS: IPF and NSCLC datasets of expression profiles were obtained from the GEO 
      database. Firstly, to detect the shared dysregulated genes positively correlated 
      with both IPF and NSCLC, differentially expressed analysis and WGCNA analysis 
      were carried out. Functional enrichment and the construction of protein-protein 
      network were employed to reveal pathogenic mechanisms related to two diseases 
      mediated by the shared dysregulated genes. Then, the LASSO regression was adopted 
      for screening critical candidate biomarkers for two disorders. Moreover, ROC 
      curves were applied to evaluate the diagnostic value of the candidate biomarkers 
      in both IPF and NSCLC. RESULTS: The 20 shared dysregulated genes positively 
      correlated with both IPF and NSCLC were identified after intersecting 
      differentially expressed analysis and WGCNA analysis. Functional enrichment 
      revealed the 20 shared genes mostly enriched in extracellular region, which is 
      critical in the organization of extracellular matrix. The protein-protein 
      networks unrevealed the interaction of the 11 shared genes involving in collagen 
      deposition and the connection between PYCR1 with PSAT1. PSAT1, PYCR1, COL10A1 and 
      KIAA1683 were screened by the LASSO regression. ROC curves comprising area under 
      the curve (AUC) verified the potential diagnostic value of PSAT1 and COL10A1 in 
      both IPF and NSCLC. CONCLUSIONS: We revealed dysregulated extracellular matrix 
      through aberrant expression of the relevant genes, which provided further 
      understanding for the common molecular mechanisms predisposing the occurrence of 
      both IPF and NSCLC.

AB  - Arsenic exposure is connected with lung toxicity and is related to lung fibrotic 
      changes. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by extracellular 
      matrix (ECM) deposition. Various genetic mechanisms and environmental factors 
      induce or exacerbate pulmonary fibrosis. Collagen synthesis induced by sodium 
      arsenite (NaAsO(2)) is closely associated with IPF. Fibroblasts tend to fine-tune 
      their metabolic networks to support their synthetic requirements in response to 
      environmental stimuli. Alterations in metabolism have an influential role in the 
      pathogenesis of IPF. However, it is unclear how arsenic affects the metabolism in 
      IPF. The urea cycle (UC) is needed for collagen formation, which provides 
      adequate levels of proline (Pro) for biosynthesis of collagen. Carbamoyl 
      phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) converts the ammonia to carbamoyl phosphate, which 
      controls the first reaction of the UC. We show that, in arsenite-exposed mice, 
      high amounts of ammonia in the lung microenvironment promotes the expression 
      levels of CPS1 and the Pro metabolism. Reduction of ammonia and CPS1 ablation 
      inhibit collagen synthesis and ameliorate IPF phenotypes induced by arsenite. 
      This work takes advantage of multi-omics data to enhance understanding of the 
      underlying pathogenic mechanisms, the key molecules and the complicated cellular 
      responses to this pollutant, which provide a target for the prevention of 
      pulmonary fibrosis caused by arsenic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anti-MDA5 (Melanoma differentiation-associated protein-5) positive 
      dermatomyositis (MDA5(+)-DM) is characterised by rapidly progressive interstitial 
      lung disease (ILD) and high mortality. MDA5 is an RNA sensor and a key pattern 
      recognition receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. METHODS: This is a retrospective 
      observational study of a surge in MDA5 autoimmunity, as determined using a 15 
      muscle-specific autoantibodies (MSAs) panel, between Janurary 2018 and December 
      2022 in Yorkshire, UK. MDA5-positivity was correlated with clinical features and 
      outcome, and regional SARS-CoV-2 positivity and vaccination rates. Gene 
      expression patterns in COVID-19 were compared with autoimmune lung disease and 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) to gain clues into the genesis of the 
      observed MDA5(+)-DM outbreak. FINDINGS: Sixty new anti-MDA5+, but not other MSAs 
      surged between 2020 and 2022, increasing from 0.4% in 2019 to 2.1% (2020), 4.8% 
      (2021) and 1.7% (2022). Few (8/60) had a prior history of confirmed COVID-19, 
      peak rates overlapped with regional SARS-COV-2 community positivity rates in 
      2021, and 58% (35/60) had received anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. 25/60 cases 
      developed ILD which rapidly progression with death in 8 cases. Among the 35/60 
      non-ILD cases, 14 had myositis, 17 Raynaud phenomena and 10 had dermatomyositis 
      spectrum rashes. Transcriptomic studies showed strong IFIH1 (gene encoding for 
      MDA5) induction in COVID-19 and autoimmune-ILD, but not IPF, and IFIH1 strongly 
      correlated with an IL-15-centric type-1 interferon response and an activated CD8+ 
      T cell signature that is an immunologic hallmark of progressive ILD in the 
      setting of systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases. The IFIH1 rs1990760TT variant 
      blunted such response. INTERPRETATION: A distinct pattern of MDA5-autoimmunity 
      cases surged contemporaneously with circulation of the SARS-COV-2 virus during 
      COVID-19. Bioinformatic insights suggest a shared immunopathology with known 
      autoimmune lung disease mechanisms. FUNDING: This work was supported in part by

OAB - One of the significant advances in the biology of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
      (IPF) has been the recognition of fibroblast heterogeneity in the lung. 
      Fibroblast heterogeneity can be interpreted as fibroblast subtypes, probably 
      derived from distinct mesenchymal lineages, as well as various activation states, 
      such as proliferation, matrix production and invasiveness. With great interest, 
      we read the original work by Mayr et al. [1] presenting a concept that the 
      Sfrp1(+) transitional fibroblasts with low invasive capacity emerge early after 
      bleomycin-induced injury and ultimately transit to Spp1/Cthrc1(+) 
      matrix-producing (myo)fibroblasts with the driving force of transforming growth 
      factor (TGF)beta1 signalling from myeloid and epithelial lineages. This study 
      largely aligns with our recent publication proposing that multiple fibroblast 
      subtypes from IPF lungs contribute to the invasive phenotype of fibroblasts and 
      the matrix deposition in pulmonary fibrosis [2].

AB  - BACKGROUND: Extracellular mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is released from damaged 
      cells and increases in the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients. While increased levels of serum 
      mtDNA have been reported to be linked to disease progression and the future 
      development of acute exacerbation (AE) of IPF (AE-IPF), the clinical significance 
      of mtDNA in BALF (BALF-mtDNA) remains unclear. We investigated the relationships 
      between BALF-mtDNA levels and other clinical variables and prognosis in IPF. 
      METHODS: Extracellular mtDNA levels in BALF samples collected from IPF patients 
      were determined using droplet-digital PCR. Levels of extracellular nucleolar DNA 
      in BALF (BALF-nucDNA) were also determined as a marker for simple cell collapse. 
      Patient characteristics and survival information were retrospectively reviewed. 
      RESULTS: mtDNA levels in serum and BALF did not correlate with each other. In 27 
      patients with paired BALF samples obtained in a stable state and at the time of 
      AE diagnosis, BALF-mtDNA levels were significantly increased at the time of AE. 
      Elevated BALF-mtDNA levels were associated with inflammation or disordered 
      pulmonary function in a stable state (n = 90), while being associated with age 
      and BALF-neutrophils at the time of AE (n = 38). BALF-mtDNA >/= 4234.3 copies/microL in 
      a stable state (median survival time (MST): 42.4 vs. 79.6 months, p < 0.001) 
      and >/= 11,194.3 copies/microL at the time of AE (MST: 2.6 vs. 20.0 months, p = 0.03) 
      were associated with shorter survival after BALF collection, even after adjusting 
      for other known prognostic factors. On the other hand, BALF-nucDNA showed 
      different trends in correlation with other clinical variables and did not show 
      any significant association with survival time. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated BALF-mtDNA 
      was associated with a poor prognosis in both IPF and AE-IPF. Of note, at the time 
      of AE, it sharply distinguished survivors from non-survivors. Given the trends 
      shown by analyses for BALF-nucDNA, the elevation of BALF-mtDNA might not simply 
      reflect the impact of cell collapse. Further studies are required to explore the 
      underlying mechanisms and clinical applications of BALF-mtDNA in IPF.

TI  - Effect of LRRC15 on autophagy in A549 cells.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, chronic, and irreversible 
      interstitial lung disease with unknown cause. To explore the role and regulatory 
      mechanism of leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 15 (LRRC15) in IPF, bleomycin 
      (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mouse and A549 cells were constructed, and 
      the expression of LRRC15 were detected. Then, MTT, GFP-RFP-LC3 dual fluorescent 
      labeling system and Western blotting were used to investigate the effects of 
      LRRC15 on cell activity and autophagy after transfection of siLRRC15, 
      respectively. The results indicated that the expression of LRRC15 was 
      significantly increased after the BLM treatment in mouse lung tissue and A549 
      cells. The designed and synthesized siLRRC15 followed by transfection into A549 
      cells resulted in a dramatic reduction in LRRC15 expression and partially 
      restored the cell damage induced by BLM. Moreover, the expression of LC3-II and 
      P62 were up-regulated, the amount of autophagosome were increased by GFP-RFP-LC3 
      dual fluorescent labeling assay after BLM treatment. Meanwhile, this study also 
      showed that the key autophagy proteins LC3-II, ATG5 and ATG7 were up-regulated, 
      P62 was down-regulated and autophagic flux were enhanced after further treatment 
      of A549 cells with siLRRC15. The above findings suggest that LRRC15 is an 
      indicator of epithelial cell damage and may participate in the regulation of 
      fibrosis through autophagy mechanism in IPF. This study provides necessary 
      theoretical basis for further elucidating the mechanism of IPF.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare, chronic and progressively 
      worsening lung disease that poses a significant threat to patient prognosis, with 
      a mortality rate exceeding that of some common malignancies. Effective methods 
      for early diagnosis and treatment remain for this condition are elusive. In our 
      study, we used the GEO database to access second-generation sequencing data and 
      associated clinical information from IPF patients. By utilizing bioinformatics 
      techniques, we identified crucial disease-related genes and their biological 
      functions, and characterized their expression patterns. Furthermore, we mapped 
      out the immune landscape of IPF, which revealed potential roles for novel kinase 
      1 and CD8+T cells in disease progression and outcome. These findings can aid the 
      development of new strategies for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of IPF.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive respiratory 
      disorder characterized by poor prognosis, often presenting with acute 
      exacerbation. The primary cause of death associated with IPF is acute 
      exacerbation of IPF (AE-IPF). However, the pathophysiology of acute exacerbation 
      has not been clearly elucidated yet. This study aims to investigate the 
      underlying pathophysiological molecular mechanism in a mouse AE-PF model. 
      C57BL/6J mice were intratracheally administered bleomycin (BLM, 5 mg/kg) to 
      induce pulmonary fibrosis. After 14 days, lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 2 mg/kg) was 
      injected via the trachea route. Histological assessments, including H&E and 
      Masson staining, as well as inflammatory indicators, were included to evaluate 
      the induction of AE-PF by BLM and LPS in mice. Transcriptomic profiling of 
      pulmonary tissues identified CSF3 as one of the top 10 upregulated DEGs in AE-PF 
      mice. Indeed, administration of exogenous CSF3 protein exacerbated AE-PF in mice. 
      Mechanistically, CSF3 disrupted alveolar epithelial barrier integrity and 
      permeability by regulating specialized cell adhesion complexes such as tight 
      junctions (TJs) and adherens junctions (AJs) via PI3K/p-Akt/Snail pathway, 
      contributing to the aggravation of AE-PF in mice. Moreover, the discovery of 
      elevated sera CSF3 indicated a notable increase in IPF patients during the 
      exacerbation of the disease. Pearson correlation analysis in IPF patients 
      revealed significant positive associations between CSF3 levels and KL-6 levels, 
      LDH levels, CRP levels, respectively. These results provide mechanistic insights 
      into the role of CSF3 in exacerbating of lung fibrotic disease and indicate 
      monitoring CSF3 levels may aid in early clinical decisions for alternative 
      therapy in the management of rapidly progressing IPF.

TI  - Genetic liability of gut microbiota for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and lung 
      function: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The microbiota-gut-lung axis has elucidated a potential association 
      between gut microbiota and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, there is 
      a paucity of population-level studies with providing robust evidence for 
      establishing causality. This two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis 
      aimed to investigate the causal relationship between the gut microbiota and IPF 
      as well as lung function. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adhering to Mendel's principle 
      of inheritance, this MR analysis utilized summary-level data from respective 
      genome-wide association studies (GWAS) involving 211 gut microbial taxa, IPF, and 
      lung function indicators such as FEV(1), FVC, and FEV(1)/FVC. A bidirectional 
      two-sample MR design was employed, utilizing multiple MR analysis methods, 
      including inverse variance-weighted (IVW), weighted median, MR-Egger, and 
      weighted mode. Multivariable MR (MVMR) was used to uncover mediating factors 
      connecting the exposure and outcome. Additionally, comprehensive sensitivity 
      analyses were conducted to ensure the robustness of the results. RESULTS: The MR 
      results confirmed four taxa were found causally associated with the risk of IPF. 
      Order Bifidobacteriales (OR=0.773, 95% CI: 0.610-0.979, p=0.033), Family 
      Bifidobacteriaceae (OR=0.773, 95% CI: 0.610-0.979, p=0.033), and Genus 
      RuminococcaceaeUCG009 (OR=0.793, 95% CI: 0.652-0.965, p=0.020) exerted protective 
      effects on IPF, while Genus Coprococcus2 (OR=1.349, 95% CI: 1.021-1.783, p=0.035) 
      promote the development of IPF. Several taxa were causally associated with lung 
      function, with those in Class Deltaproteobacteria, Order Desulfovibrionales, 
      Family Desulfovibrionaceae, Class Verrucomicrobiae, Order Verrucomicrobiales and 
      Family Verrucomicrobiaceae being the most prominent beneficial microbiota, while 
      those in Family Lachnospiraceae, Genus Oscillospira, and Genus Parasutterella 
      were associated with impaired lung function. As for the reverse analysis, MR 
      results confirmed the effects of FEV(1) and FVC on the increased abundance of six 
      taxa (Phylum Actinobacteria, Class Actinobacteria, Order Bifidobacteriales, 
      Family Bifidobacteriaceae, Genus Bifidobacterium, and Genus Ruminiclostridium9) 
      with a boosted level of evidence. MVMR suggested monounsaturated fatty acids, 
      total fatty acids, saturated fatty acids, and ratio of omega-6 fatty acids to 
      total fatty acids as potential mediating factors in the genetic association 
      between gut microbiota and IPF. CONCLUSION: The current study suggested the 
      casual effects of the specific gut microbes on the risk of IPF and lung function. 
      In turn, lung function also exerted a positive role in some gut microbes. A 
      reasonable dietary intake of lipid substances has a certain protective effect 
      against the occurrence and progression of IPF. This study provides novel insights 
      into the potential role of gut microbiota in IPF and indicates a possible gut 
      microbiota-mediated mechanism for the prevention of IPF.

TI  - Association between mosaic loss of chromosome Y and pulmonary fibrosis 
      susceptibility and severity.

AB  - Background Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a rare lung disease with diverse 
      pathogenesis and multiple interconnected underlying biological mechanisms. Mosaic 
      loss of chromosome Y (mLOY) is one of the most common forms of acquired 
      chromosome abnormality in men, which has been reported to be associated with 
      increased risk of various chronic progressive diseases including fibrotic 
      diseases. However, the exact role of mLOY in the development of PF remains 
      elusive and to be elucidated. METHODS: We adopted three complementary approaches 
      to explore the role of mLOY in the pathogenesis of PF. We used copy number on 
      chromosome Y to estimate mLOY comparing patients in PROFILE and gnomAD cohorts 
      and between cases and control patients from the GE100KGP cohort. Correlation of 
      mLOY with demographic and clinical variables was tested using patients from 
      PROFILE cohort. Lung single-cell transcriptomic data were analysed to assess the 
      cell types implicated in mLOY. We performed Mendelian randomisation to examine 
      the causal relationship between mLOY, IPF, and telomere length. RESULTS: The 
      genetic analysis suggests that mLOY is found in PF from both case cohorts but 
      when compared with an age matched population the effect is minimal (P = 0.0032). 
      mLOY is related to age (P = 0.00021) and shorter telomere length (P = 0.0081) 
      rather than PF severity or progression. Single-cell analysis indicates that mLOY 
      appears to be found primarily in immune cells and appears to be related to 
      presence and severity of fibrosis. Mendelian randomisation demonstrates that mLOY 
      is not on the causal pathway for IPF, but partial evidence supports that telomere 
      shortening is on the causal pathway for mLOY. CONCLUSION: Our study confirms the 
      existence of mLOY in PF patients and suggests that mLOY is not a major driver of 
      IPF. The combined evidence suggests a triangulation model where telomere 
      shortening leads to both IPF and mLOY.

AB  - The study aimed to investigate the expression profiles of transcription factors, 
      cytokines, and co-stimulatory molecules in helper T (Th)-cell subsets within 
      bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples of patients with interstitial lung diseases 
      (ILDs). Twenty ILDs patients were included in the study, comprising those with 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) (n:8), autoimmune-related ILDs (auto-ILD) 
      (n:4), and orphan diseases (O-ILD) (n:8), alongside five control subjects. Flow 
      cytometry was employed to evaluate the Th to cytotoxic T cell (CTL) ratio in BAL 
      fluid, while cytopathological examination assessed macrophages, lymphocytes, and 
      neutrophils. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was utilized to 
      investigate the expressions in Th1, Th2, Th17, and regulatory T (Treg) cells. 
      Results revealed elevated Th cell to CTL ratios across all patient groups 
      compared to controls. Furthermore, upregulation of Th1, Th2, Th17, and T-cell 
      factors was observed in all patient groups compared to controls. Interestingly, 
      upregulation of CD28 and downregulation of CTLA-4 and PD-1 gene expression were 
      consistent across all ILDs groups, highlighting potential immune dysregulation. 
      This study provides a comprehensive exploration of molecular immunological 
      mechanisms in ILDs patients, underscoring the dominance of Th2 and Th17 responses 
      and revealing novel findings regarding the dysregulation of CD28, CTLA-4, and 
      PD-1 expressions in ILDs for the first time.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a debilitating interstitial lung disease 
      characterized by progressive fibrosis and poor prognosis. Despite advancements in 
      treatment, the pathophysiological mechanisms of IPF remain elusive. Herein, we 
      conducted an integrated bioinformatics analysis combining clinical data and 
      carried out experimental validations to unveil the intricate molecular mechanism 
      of IPF. Leveraging three IPF datasets, we identified 817 upregulated and 560 
      downregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Of these, 14 DEGs associated 
      with copper metabolism were identified, shedding light on the potential 
      involvement of disrupted copper metabolism in IPF progression. Immune 
      infiltration analysis revealed dysregulated immune cell infiltration in IPF, with 
      a notable correlation between copper metabolism-related genes and immune cells. 
      Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified a central module 
      correlated with IPF-associated genes, among which STEAP2 emerged as a key hub 
      gene. Subsequent in vivo and in vitro studies confirmed the upregulation of 
      STEAP2 in IPF model. Knockdown of STEAP2 using siRNA alleviated fibrosis 
      in vitro, suggesting potential pathway related to copper metabolism in the 
      pathophysiological progression of IPF. Our study established a novel link between 
      immune cell infiltration and dysregulated copper metabolism. The revelation of 
      intracellular copper overload and upregulated STEAP2 unravelled a potential 
      therapeutic option. These findings offer valuable insights for future research 
      and therapeutic interventions targeting STEAP2 and associated pathways in IPF.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a common, chronic, and progressive lung 
      disease that severely impacts human health and survival. However, the intricate 
      molecular underpinnings of IPF remains elusive. This study aims to delve into the 
      nuanced molecular interplay of cellular interactions in IPF, thereby laying the 
      groundwork for innovative therapeutic approaches in the clinical field of IPF. 
      Sophisticated bioinformatics methods were employed to identify crucial biomarkers 
      essential for the progression of IPF. The GSE122960 single-cell dataset was 
      obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) compendium, and intercellular 
      communication potentialities were scrutinized via CellChat. The random survival 
      forest paradigm was established using the GSE70866 dataset. Quintessential genes 
      were selected through Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves, while immune infiltration 
      examinations, functional enrichment critiques and nomogram paradigms were 
      inaugurated. Analysis of intercellular communication revealed an intimate 
      potential connections between macrophages and various cell types, pinpointing 
      five cardinal genes influencing the trajectory and prognosis of IPF. The nomogram 
      paradigm, sculpted from these seminal genes, exhibits superior predictive 
      prowess. Our research meticulously identified five critical genes, confirming 
      their intimate association with the prognosis, immune infiltration and 
      transcriptional governance of IPF. Interestingly, we discerned these genes' 
      engagement with the EPITHELIAL_MESENCHYMAL_TRANSITION signalling pathway, which 
      may enhance our understanding of the molecular complexity of IPF.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Single cell RNA sequencing technology (scRNA-seq) has been proven 
      useful in understanding cell-specific disease mechanisms. However, identifying 
      genes of interest remains a key challenge. Pseudo-bulk methods that pool 
      scRNA-seq counts in the same biological replicates have been commonly used to 
      identify differentially expressed genes. However, such methods may lack power due 
      to the limited sample size of scRNA-seq datasets, which can be prohibitively 
      expensive. RESULTS: Motivated by this, we proposed to use the 
      Bayesian-frequentist hybrid (BFH) framework to increase the power and we showed 
      in simulated scenario, the proposed BFH would be an optimal method when compared 
      with other popular single cell differential expression methods if both FDR and 
      power were considered. As an example, the method was applied to an idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) case study. CONCLUSION: In our IPF example, we 
      demonstrated that with a proper informative prior, the BFH approach identified 
      more genes of interest. Furthermore, these genes were reasonable based on the 
      current knowledge of IPF. Thus, the BFH offers a unique and flexible framework 
      for future scRNA-seq analyses.

AB  - To date there are only pirfenidone (PFD) and nintedanib to be given conditional 
      recommendation in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) therapies with slowing 
      disease progression, but neither has prospectively shown a reduced mortality. It 
      is one of the urgent topics to find effective drugs for pulmonary fibrosis in 
      medicine. Previous studies have demonstrated that microcystin-RR (MC-RR) 
      effectively alleviates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, but the mechanism 
      has not been fully elucidated yet. We further conducted a comparison of 
      therapeutic effect on the model animals of pulmonary fibrosis between MC-RR and 
      PFD with histopathology and the expression of the molecular markers involved in 
      differentiation, proliferation and metabolism of myofibroblasts, a major effector 
      cell of tissue fibrosis. The levels of the enzyme molecules for maintaining the 
      stability of interstitial structure were also evaluated. Our results showed that 
      MC-RR and PFD effectively alleviated pulmonary fibrosis in model mice with a 
      decreased signaling and marker molecules associated with myofibroblast 
      differentiation and lung fibrotic lesion. In the meantime, both MC-RR and PFD 
      treatment are beneficial to restore molecular dynamics of interstitial tissue and 
      maintain the stability of interstitial architecture. Unexpectedly, MC-RR, rather 
      than PFD, showed a significant effect on inhibiting PKM2-HIF-1alpha signaling and 
      reducing the level of p-STAT3. Additionally, MC-RR showed a better inhibition 
      effect on FGFR1 expression. Given that PKM2-HIF-1alpha and activated STAT3 molecular 
      present a critical role in promoting the proliferation of myofibroblasts, MC-RR 
      as a new strategy for IPF treatment has potential advantage over PFD.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is believed to be associated with a notable 
      disruption of cellular energy metabolism. By detecting the changes of energy 
      metabolites in the serum of patients with pulmonary fibrosis, we aimed to 
      investigate the diagnostic and prognostic value of energy metabolites in IPF, and 
      further elucidated the mechanism of their involvement in pulmonary fibrosis. 
      Through metabolomics research, it was discovered that the TCA cycle intermediates 
      changed dramatically in IPF patients. In another validation cohort of 55 patients 
      with IPF compared to 19 healthy controls, it was found that succinate, an 
      intermediate product of TCA cycle, has diagnostic and prognostic value in IPF. 
      The cut-off levels of serum succinate were 98.36 muM for distinguishing IPF from 
      healthy controls (sensitivity, 83.64%; specificity, 63.16%; likelihood ratio, 
      2.27, respectively). Moreover, a high serum succinate level was independently 
      associated with higher rates of disease progression (OR 13.087, 95%CI 
      (2.819-60.761)) and mortality (HR 3.418, 95% CI (1.308-8.927)). In addition, 
      accumulation of succinate and increased expression of the succinate receptor 
      GPR91 were found in both IPF patients and BLM mouse models of pulmonary fibrosis. 
      Reducing succinate accumulation in BLM mice alleviated pulmonary fibrosis and 21d 
      mortality, while exogenous administration of succinate can aggravate pulmonary 
      fibrosis in BLM mice. Furthermore, GPR91 deficiency protected against lung 
      fibrosis caused by BLM. In vitro, succinate promoted the activation of lung 
      fibroblasts by activating ERK pathway through GPR91. In summary, succinate is a 
      promising biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis of IPF. The accumulation of 
      succinate may promote fibroblast activation through GPR91 and pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages (Mo_AMs) are increasingly 
      recognised as potential pathogenic factors for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
      (IPF). While scRNAseq analysis has proven valuable in the transcriptome profiling 
      of Mo_AMs, the integration analysis of multi-omics may provide additional 
      dimensions of understanding of these cellular populations. METHODS: We performed 
      multi-omics analysis on 116 scRNAseq, 119 bulkseq and five scATACseq lung tissue 
      samples from IPF. We built a large-scale IPF scRNAseq atlas and conducted the 
      Monocle 2/3 as well as the Cellchat to explore the developmental path and 
      intercellular communication on Mo_AMs. We also reported the difference in 
      metabolisms, tissue repair and phagocytosis between Mo_AMs and tissue-resident 
      alveolar macrophages (TRMs). To determine whether Mo_AMs affected pulmonary 
      function, we projected clinical phenotypes (FVC%pred) from the bulkseq dataset 
      onto the scRNAseq atlas. Finally, we used scATATCseq to uncover the upstream 
      regulatory mechanisms and determine key drivers in Mo_AMs. RESULTS: We identified 
      three Mo_AMs clusters and the trajectory analysis further validated the origin of 
      these clusters. Moreover, via the Cellchat analysis, the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis was 
      found to be involved in the molecular basis of reciprocal interactions between 
      Mo_AMs and fibroblasts through the activation of the ERK pathway in Mo_AMs. 
      SPP1_RecMacs (RecMacs, recruited macrophages) were higher in the low-FVC group 
      than in the high-FVC group. Specifically, compared with TRMs, the functions of 
      lipid and energetic metabolism as well as tissue repair were higher in Mo_AMs 
      than TRMs. But, TRMs may have higher level of phagocytosis than TRMs. SPIB 
      (PU.1), JUNB, JUND, BACH2, FOSL2, and SMARCC1 showed stronger association with 
      open chromatin of Mo_AMs than TRMs. Significant upregulated expression and deep 
      chromatin accessibility of APOE were observed in both SPP1_RecMacs and TRMs. 
      CONCLUSION: Through trajectory analysis, it was confirmed that SPP1_RecMacs 
      derived from Monocytes. Besides, Mo_AMs may influence FVC% pred and aggravate 
      pulmonary fibrosis through the communication with fibroblasts. Furthermore, 
      distinctive transcriptional regulators between Mo_AMs and TRMs implied that they 
      may depend on different upstream regulatory mechanisms. Overall, this work 
      provides a global overview of how Mo_AMs govern IPF and also helps determine 
      better approaches and intervention therapies.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is considered to be associated with aging. 
      Both ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) have been associated with 
      pulmonary fibrosis via key mechanisms including AEC apoptosis, EMT, altered 
      myofibroblast differentiation, and M2 macrophage polarization. A relationship 
      between ER stress and aging has also been demonstrated in vitro, with increased 
      p16 and p21 levels seen in lung epithelial cells of older IPF patients. The 
      mechanism underlying ER stress regulation of IPF fibroblasts is still unclear. In 
      this study, we aimed to delineate ER stress regulation in IPF-derived 
      fibroblasts. Here, we found that ER stress markers (p-eIF2alpha, p-IREalpha, ATF6) and 
      fibrosis markers (alpha-SMA and Collagen-I) were significantly increased in lung 
      tissues of IPF patients and bleomycin-induced mouse models. Notably, the 
      expression of PGC-1alpha was decreased in fibroblasts. In vivo experiments were 
      designed using an AAV-6 vector mediated conditional PGC-1alpha knockout driven by a 
      specific alpha-SMA promoter. Ablation of PGC-1alpha expression in fibroblasts promoted ER 
      stress and supported the development of pulmonary fibrosis in a bleomycin-induced 
      mouse model. In another experimental group, mice with conditional knockout of 
      PGC-1alpha in fibroblasts and injected intraperitoneally with 4-PBA (an endoplasmic 
      reticulum stress inhibitor) were protected from lung fibrosis. We further 
      constructed an AAV-6 vector mediated PGC-1alpha overexpression model driven by a 
      specific Collagen-I promoter. Overexpression of PGC-1alpha in fibroblasts suppressed 
      ER stress and attenuated development of pulmonary fibrosis in bleomycin-induced 
      mouse models. Taken together, this study identified PGC-1alpha as a promising target 
      for developing novel therapeutic options for the treatment of lung fibrosis.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most predominant type of idiopathic 
      interstitial pneumonia and has an increasing incidence, poor prognosis, and 
      unclear pathogenesis. In order to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying 
      IPF further, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing analysis on three healthy 
      controls and five IPF lung tissue samples. The results revealed a significant 
      shift in epithelial cells (ECs) phenotypes in IPF, which may be attributed to the 
      differentiation of alveolar type 2 cells to basal cells. In addition, several 
      previously unrecognized basal cell subtypes were preliminarily identified, 
      including extracellular matrix basal cells, which were increased in the IPF 
      group. We identified a special population of fibroblasts that highly expressed 
      extracellular matrix-related genes, POSTN, CTHRC1, COL3A1, COL5A2, and COL12A1. 
      We propose that the close interaction between ECs and fibroblasts through 
      ligand-receptor pairs may have a critical function in IPF development. 
      Collectively, these outcomes provide innovative perspectives on the complexity 
      and diversity of basal cells and fibroblasts in IPF and contribute to the 
      understanding of possible mechanisms in pathological lung fibrosis.

AB  - To explore the causal relationship between gut microbiota (GM) and Idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), we performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR). 
      GM was used as an exposure factor, and instrumental variables were determined 
      from the GWAS of 18,340 participants. GWAS of IPF (including 1028 IPF patients 
      and 196,986 controls) from the FinnGen was used as the outcome factor. The 
      primary analysis method is the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method, and 
      sensitivity analysis was used to validate the reliability. Family Bacteroidaceae 
      (OR = 1.917 95% CI = 1.083-3.393, P = .026), order Gastranaerophilales 
      (OR = 1.441 95% CI = 1.019-2.036, P = .039), genus Senegalimassilia (OR = 2.28 
      95% CI = 1.174-4.427, P = .015), phylum Cyanobacteria (OR = 1.631 95% 
      CI = 1.035-2.571, P = .035) were positively correlated with IPF. 
      FamilyXIII(OR = 0.452 95% CI = 0.249-0.82, P = .009), order Selenomonadale 
      (OR = 0.563 95% CI = 0.337-0.941, P = .029), genus Veillonella (OR = 0.546 95% 
      CI = 0.304-0.982, P = .043) (OR = 0.717 95% CI = 0.527-0.976, P = .034), genus 
      Ruminococcusgnavus (OR = 0.717 95% CI = 0.527-0.976, P = .034), genus 
      Oscillibacter (OR = 0.571 95% CI = 0.405-0.806, P = .001) was negatively 
      correlated with IPF. Sensitivity analysis showed no evidence of pleiotropy or 
      heterogeneity (P > .05). The results of MR demonstrated a causal relationship 
      between GM and IPF. Further studies are needed to investigate the intrinsic 
      mechanisms of the GM in the pathogenesis of IPF.

TI  - ADAM15 in Fibroblasts: Improving the Matrix Remodeling by Blocking the Action of 
      Transforming Growth Factor-beta1.
PG  - 363-370
AB  - OBJECTIVE: During the progression of chronic idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), 
      maladaptive tissue remodeling including excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) 
      deposition occurs, which eventually leads to architectural distortion and loss of 
      organ function in organ fibrosis. ADAM15, which is highly expressed in the 
      developing lungs and kidneys, is a transmembrane-anchored multidomain protein 
      belonging to the family of metalloproteinases. Compared to the extensive studies 
      about functions of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), less are discussed about 
      ADAM15, particularly in function and mechanism involving fibrogenesis. Our study 
      aims to fill in this gap. METHODS: We identified ADAM15 as a novel antifibrotic 
      mediator in lung fibrosis. We found that ADAM15 has cross-talks with transforming 
      growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), which is the most potent profibrotic mediator. We 
      provided molecular and translational evidence that knockdown of ADAM15 
      accelerated fibrogenic response induced by TGF-beta1 and upregulation of ADAM15 
      rescued TGF-beta1-induced myofibroblast activation in part. RESULTS: Overexpression 
      of ADAM15 ameliorates fibrotic changes and ADAM15 deficiency exacerbates changes 
      from fibroblast to myofibroblast in NIH/3T3. Results were also presented and 
      identified by the intuitive immunofluorescence staining. CONCLUSION: In this 
      study, we uncover a new molecular mechanism of tissue fibrogenesis and identify

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a respiratory disorder of 
      obscure etiology and limited treatment options, possibly linked to dysregulation 
      in lipid metabolism. While several observational studies suggest that 
      lipid-lowering agents may decrease the risk of IPF, the evidence is inconsistent. 
      The present Mendelian randomization (MR) study aims to determine the association 
      between circulating lipid traits and IPF and to assess the potential influence of 
      lipid-modifying medications for IPF. METHODS: Summary statistics of 5 lipid 
      traits (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol, triglyceride, apolipoprotein A, and apolipoprotein B) and IPF were 
      sourced from the UK Biobank and FinnGen Project Round 10. The study's focus on 
      lipid-regulatory genes encompassed PCSK9, NPC1L1, ABCG5, ABCG8, HMGCR, APOB, 
      LDLR, CETP, ANGPTL3, APOC3, LPL, and PPARA. The primary effect estimates were 
      determined using the inverse-variance-weighted method, with additional analyses 
      employing the contamination mixture method, robust adjusted profile score, the 
      weighted median, weighted mode methods, and MR-Egger. Summary-data-based 
      Mendelian randomization (SMR) was used to confirm significant lipid-modifying 
      drug targets, leveraging data on expressed quantitative trait loci in relevant 
      tissues. Sensitivity analyses included assessments of heterogeneity, horizontal 
      pleiotropy, and leave-one-out methods. RESULTS: There was no significant effect 
      of blood lipid traits on IPF risk (all P＞0.05). Drug-target MR analysis indicated 
      that genetic mimicry for inhibitor of NPC1L1, PCSK9, ABCG5, ABCG8, and APOC3 were 
      associated with increased IPF risks, with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence 
      intervals (CIs) as follows: 2.74 (1.05-7.12, P = 0.039), 1.36 (1.02-1.82, P = 
      0.037), 1.66 (1.12-2.45, P = 0.011), 1.68 (1.14-2.48, P = 0.009), and 1.42 
      (1.20-1.67, P = 3.17x10(-5)), respectively. The SMR method identified a 
      significant association between PCSK9 gene expression in whole blood and reduced 
      IPF risk (OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.50-0.99, P = 0.043). Sensitivity analyses showed 
      no evidence of bias. CONCLUSIONS: Serum lipid traits did not significantly affect 
      the risk of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Drug targets MR studies examining 12 
      lipid-modifying drugs indicated that PCSK9 inhibitors could dramatically increase 
      IPF risk, a mechanism that may differ from their lipid-lowering actions and thus 
      warrants further investigation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Treating Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remains challenging 
      owing to its relentless progression, grim prognosis, and the scarcity of 
      effective treatment options. Emerging evidence strongly supports the critical 
      role of accelerated senescence in alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) in driving the 
      progression of IPF. Consequently, targeting senescent AECs emerges as a promising 
      therapeutic strategy for IPF. PURPOSE: Curcumin analogue EF24 is a derivative of 
      curcumin and shows heightened bioactivity encompassing anti-inflammatory, 
      anti-tumor and anti-aging properties. The objective of this study was to 
      elucidate the therapeutic potential and underlying molecular mechanisms of EF24 
      in the treatment of IPF. METHODS: A549 and ATII cells were induced to become 
      senescent using bleomycin. Senescence markers were examined using different 
      methods including senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal) staining, 
      western blotting, and q-PCR. Mice were intratracheally administrated with 
      bleomycin to induce pulmonary fibrosis. This was validated by micro-computed 
      tomography (CT), masson trichrome staining, and transmission electron microscope 
      (TEM). The role and underlying mechanisms of EF24 in IPF were determined in vitro 
      and in vivo by evaluating the expressions of PTEN, AKT/mTOR/NF-kappaB signaling 
      pathway, and mitophagy using western blotting or flow cytometry. RESULTS: We 
      identified that the curcumin analogue EF24 was the most promising candidate among 
      12 compounds against IPF. EF24 treatment significantly reduced senescence 
      biomarkers in bleomycin-induced senescent AECs, including SA-beta-Gal, PAI-1, P21, 
      and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). EF24 also effectively 
      inhibited fibroblast activation which was induced by senescent AECs or TGF-beta. We 
      revealed that PTEN activation was integral for EF24 to inhibit AECs senescence by 
      suppressing the AKT/mTOR/NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Additionally, EF24 improved 
      mitochondrial dysfunction through induction of mitophagy. Furthermore, EF24 
      administration significantly reduced the senescent phenotype induced by bleomycin 
      in the lung tissues of mice. Notably, EF24 mitigates fibrosis and promotes 
      overall health benefits in both the acute and chronic phases of IPF, suggesting 
      its therapeutic potential in IPF treatment. CONCLUSION: These findings 
      collectively highlight EF24 as a new and effective therapeutic agent against IPF 
      by inhibiting senescence in AECs.

      pulmonary fibrosis based on PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway].
PG  - 3878-3886
LID - 10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20240321.701 [doi]
AB  - To investigate the mechanism by which Peitu Yifei Granules inhibit idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis(IPF) in rats, fifty specific-pathogen-free(SPF) grade male 
      Wistar rats were randomly divided into blank group and modeling group. IPF was 
      induced in the modeling group rats by tracheal infusion of 5 mg.kg~(-1) 
      bleomycin(BLM) and then randomly divided into model group, pirfenidone group, and 
      high-dose, medium-dose, and low-dose groups treated with Peitu Yifei Granules. 
      After 24 hours of modeling, the treatment groups received intragastric 
      administration of either Peitu Yifei Granules or pirfenidone as a positive 
      control drug; meanwhile, the model group received an equal volume of normal 
      saline. After 21 days of treatment administration, lung tissue samples were 
      collected for analysis. Pathological changes in lung tissues were assessed using 
      hematoxylin-eosin(HE) staining and Masson's trichrome staining. The expression 
      levels of protein kinase B(Akt), mammalian target of rapamycin(mTOR), their 
      phosphorylated forms, and sequestosome 1(p62) were determined through Western 
      blot(WB). Fluorescent quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction(RT-qPCR) 
      was used to measure messenger ribonucleic acid(mRNA) expression levels of 
      Beclin-1, microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B(LC3B), and p62. 
      Immunohistochemistry was performed to assess protein expression levels of 
      Beclin-1 and LC3B in lung tissue samples. RESULTS:: demonstrated that lung tissue 
      structure appeared normal without significant collagen deposition in the blank 
      group rats. In contrast, rats from the model group exhibited thickened alveolar 
      septa along with evident inflammatory changes and collagen deposition. Compared 
      to the model group rats, those treated with Peitu Yifei Granules or pirfenidone 
      showed significantly improved lung tissue structure with reduced inflammation and 
      collagen deposition observed histologically. Furthermore, compared with those of 
      the blank group, the expressions of p62 and its mRNA, p-Akt and p-mTOR protein in 
      lung tissues of the model group were significantly increased, while Beclin-1, 
      LC3B and their mRNA levels were significantly decreased. Compared with those of 
      the model group, the expressions of p62 and its mRNA, p-Akt and p-mTOR in lung 
      tissues of the pirfenidone group and Peitu Yifei Granules high-dose and 
      medium-dose groups were significantly decreased, while Beclin-1, LC3B and their 
      mRNA expressions were significantly increased. The above results indicate that 
      Peitu Yifei Granules can improve autophagy levels in lung tissues by inhibiting 
      the phosphoinositide 3-kinase(PI3K)/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and delay the 
      development of IPF disease.
